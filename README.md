# Welcome to the liberal_conservative Project 

This project is to predict the text if it should be liberal or conservative. We have taken more than 30 articles with far right and far left leaning objectives. We scrape the articles and clean it. After that, we apply NLTK to have the words categorized into unique/subjective/readbility/hard. Also, we created a scatter text graph by most frequently appeared words, TF-IDF score and the characteristic terms used. 

This screenshot shows that the scatter text plot for Liberal words frequency vs Conservative Frequency.
