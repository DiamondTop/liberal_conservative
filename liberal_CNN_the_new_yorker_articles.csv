https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-us-assassinated-suleimani-the-chief-exporter-of-irans-revolution-but-at-what-price?verso=true,"Over more than two decades, Suleimani, a Shiite, had more impact than the leaders of either Al Qaeda or ISIS, which are both Sunni movements, in shaping the face of the Middle East. To counter U.S. influence in Iraq between 2003 and 2011, he provided Iraqi militants with rockets, bombs, and explosively formed projectiles that could slice through the armor of an American M1 tank.

The United States designated the Quds Force as a supporter of terrorism, in 2007, and Suleimani was personally sanctioned for complicity in a plot to kill the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, in 2011. That same year, he spearheaded a campaign, now in its ninth year, to save President Bashar al-Assad’s regime after civil war erupted in Syria. Suleimani also channelled arms and aid to Hezbollah in Lebanon, orchestrating its franchise operations in other Middle Eastern countries, and aided Houthi rebels in Yemen. He cultivated militia proxies in Pakistan and Afghanistan, thousands of whose members were deployed to fight in Syria. Suleimani gained fame for taking selfies—later posted on social media—on the front lines of regional conflicts where his Quds Force and their allies were deployed. Many went viral.
Suleimani’s death capped a week of hostilities that escalated with lightning speed after a U.S. military contractor was killed in a rocket attack by Kata’ib Hezbollah, one of the most powerful Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, on December 27th. The attack was the group’s eleventh in recent weeks, the U.S. claimed. On December 29th, the Pentagon responded with five air strikes—three in Iraq and two in Syria—on Kata’ib Hezbollah’s bases. The group’s supporters responded by attacking the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, which is the largest and most fortified diplomatic mission in the world.

Kata’ib Hezbollah has been an increasingly important militia since it emerged, under Iranian tutelage, in 2004. After ISIS swept through Iraq, in 2014, it merged with dozens of other Shiite militias in the Popular Mobilization Forces to fight the Islamic State caliphate—with Iranian aid, arms, and Suleimani’s strategic advice. ISIS was the one issue on which Iran and the U.S. had common cause. Along with the rest of the P.M.F., Kata’ib Hezbollah was incorporated into the Iraqi military, in 2019, yet it continued to carry out its own operations—in defiance of the government and to the frustration of the United States. The militia has also been deployed in Syria as part of Iran’s support for the Assad regime.
The Pentagon provided no initial details on how the attack played out, but the Iranian media reported that Suleimani had just arrived at the Baghdad airport from Lebanon. The U.S. strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the leader of Kata’ib Hezbollah and deputy chief of the P.M.F. He was “by far the most important P.M.F. leader tied to Iran,” Silliman told me. Iranian news agencies said that Suleimani and Muhandis were leaving the airport in separate cars when both were attacked by rockets fired from a U.S. helicopter. The Tasnim news agency, which has been tied to the Revolutionary Guard in the past, tweeted a photo of a bloodied hand wearing a large ring with an oval red stone, which Suleimani was often photographed wearing. The ring was how his body was identified, Iraqi officials said.
The timing was particularly awkward for the Iraqi government, which has long attempted a delicate balancing act between neighboring Iran and the United States. Since October 1st, protests have swept across the country demanding the ouster of the Prime Minister and the entire political class, and an end to corruption and economic inequality. The protests have also been noteworthy because of their unprecedented demonstrations against Iran’s influence in Iraq. In November, protesters set fire to Iranian diplomatic missions in the Shiite holy cities of Najaf and Karbala.
The U.S. killing of Suleimani and the air strikes on Kata’ib Hezbollah over the weekend are an embarrassment to Iraqi leaders and a challenge to Iraqi sovereignty. They come at a time when Baghdad is gripped by the deepest political crisis since the U.S. invasion ousted Saddam Hussein, in 2003. The Prime Minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, a Shiite who spent years in exile in Iran, stepped down and is now playing only a caretaker role. There are already calls for the Iraqi parliament to demand the withdrawal of some five thousand U.S. troops—and hundreds more from more than a dozen coalition neighbors—that are still waging a campaign against ISIS insurgents. In a tweet, in Arabic, Mahdi called the assassination of Suleimani an act of aggression against the “Iraqi state, its government, and its people.” In an ominous signal to Washington, he said the killing was a “breach of the conditions for the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq.” The Iraqi Parliament is due to debate the U.S. military presence and vote on whether it should continue when it reconvenes, but the Prime Minister has the ultimate say as Commander-in-Chief, Silliman said.

https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/how-anti-semitism-rises-on-the-left-and-right?verso=true,"ate crimes against Jews have been on the rise around the country for several years, but this past month saw a spike in violence in the New York area. On December 10th, three people were fatally shot at a kosher supermarket in Jersey City, along with a police officer who was killed nearby. Eighteen days later, five people were stabbed at a Hanukkah celebration in an Orthodox community in Rockland County. In December, police also filed hate-crime charges against several people who attacked Orthodox Jews on the streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn. According to the Times, of the hate crimes that were reported to the New York City Police Department in 2019, more than half were directed at Jews.

There have also been increased attacks on other racial and religious groups; hate crimes against African-Americans remain the most common racially motivated hate crimes, and there has been a significant rise in violence against Latinos and the transgender community in recent years. To what extent can anti-Jewish violence be tied to other hate crimes, and to what extent should it be understood as having a distinct history and motivations? To discuss these questions, I recently spoke by phone with David Nirenberg, the dean of the Divinity School at the University of Chicago, who has written extensively on the history of anti-Semitism. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed why prejudice against Jews seems to arise in so many different eras and contexts, and the unhelpfulness of always thinking about anti-Semitism as a manifestation of politics.

Some historical eras, including ones you have written about, have been characterized by their relationship to anti-Semitism. Does it feel like we are in an era worth defining as such, and, if so, how would you characterize it?

Yeah, it does feel to me like we are in an era worth defining in terms of anti-Semitism or anti-Judaism, by which I mean we are in an era where many different societies are reviving ways of explaining the complexity of the world in terms of the dangers posed by Judaism or Jews. It is not always real Jews. There are many societies that spend a lot of time thinking about Jews and Judaism where there are no Jews actually living today. And I think we are definitely in a period in which more and more registers of multiple societies are thinking in those ways. We often think of anti-Semitic periods as periods in which thinking about Judaism is a convincing way of explaining what’s wrong with the world to people on many parts of the political spectrum, like in Europe in the first half of the twentieth century. And I think we are similarly in such a period today.

Do you think it is worth thinking of anti-Semitism today as akin to the prejudices that afflict many different religious and ethnic minorities, such as Muslims or Hispanics in the United States? Or is it distinct in important ways?

That’s a really tough question, and, in some ways, I hate to distinguish between different forms of prejudice or hate. When you think about some of the most enduring prejudices—for example, the asymmetries of power between men and women—these are structural aspects of our global society. But I do think anti-Semitism is distinctive in certain ways. One of those ways is that it really does transcend particular political contexts. There aren’t a great number of Jews in Hungary or Poland, but thinking about Jews is a crucial part of nationalism—or anti-globalization or whatever you want to call it—in Hungary and Poland today. And I think that’s different from the way most of the other groups you mentioned are used in the world’s imagination.

This is a really difficult topic to think about, and I would like to think we are each entitled to study our own hate without having to study all the others. But we can see symptoms of a distinction in our own age. I don’t think, for example, that people in many parts of the world where there aren’t Muslim immigrants are thinking really centrally about their own society in terms of Islam, and I would say the same thing might be true of some racial prejudices that are central to the United States but don’t play a very large role in other societies. But what’s curious about anti-Semitism or anti-Judaism is how it can be put to work by many societies that really have nothing to do with living Jews or Judaism.

When many of the people in these societies think about immigration, even though the problem they see isn’t Jews immigrating to these societies, they do think about Judaism in order to explain the immigration they see as threatening their society. So, in the United States, France, Hungary, and many other places, replacement-theory ideologies explain replacement in terms of the machinations of the Jews, or the Jewish global order. Anti-Judaism is actually a system of thought that people can use to explain many of the challenges they face, even when there are no Jews around. And that has a flexibility that, in the worst moments, allows many parts of society to agree that Jews are the problem in a way you don’t always see coalescing around other distinctions.

You mentioned Poland and Hungary, and what you say seems convincing. But it’s probably not coincidental that both of those countries are seeing a type of right-wing xenophobia that is not just focussed on Jews. Even though there is something unique about anti-Semitism, does it rise and fall with political trends?

I think that is absolutely right about anti-Semitism, even though I am going to keep using “anti-Judaism.” I think it is more important to understand the system of thought that understands the challenges one confronts as posed by Judaism—that’s anti-Judaism—than it is to understand the focus of anti-Semitism on real Jews who need to be attacked or defeated. I don’t think we can understand the power of anti-Semitism if we don’t first understand that vast system of thought—which was transmitted and taught by Christianity and Islam and many different kinds of thoughts, and many different kinds of philosophy, from idealism to Marxism, which really understood capital or materialism or legalism or greed in terms of Judaism. So once you understand that system of thought, you can understand why it is possible for people to imagine that their world is threatened by Judaism, even when they have no real Jews around them to be anti-Semitic toward.

But back to your original question. I think that, in every moment in which anti-Semitism really becomes an organizing principle in society, and anti-Judaism starts to do a lot of work in society, it is because of political polarizations, economic stresses, et cetera, which make that language of anti-Judaism so useful as a system of thought. Every context is different, every period is different, but the reason that anti-Semitism can be put to work in so many contexts and periods is because anti-Judaism is such an integral part of the ways we have learned to imagine the challenges we face in the material world.

What would be an example of people in the twenty-first century using anti-Judaism to describe how they see the world?"
https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/the-houses-sad-predictable-partisan-and-historic-impeachment-of-donald-trump?verso=true#intcid=recommendations_the-new-yorker-bottom-recirc-similar_4ec1d452-d6cf-4838-89c4-ad9ff650c8dc_text2vec1_text2VecSimilarity,"There was no such reckoning this time. The impeachment of Trump turned out to exclude the unanticipated; it was another day of impasse between an unrepentant President and a recalcitrant Democratic House. The feeling in the capital was one of resignation, with the conclusion so predicted and so predictable that it seemed less of a crisis than Clinton’s long-ago impeachment, not more. And yet the impeachment of Trump is arguably more consequential, in every way, for American democracy: a sign of a country in the midst of an ongoing political crisis that this President, unlike his impeached predecessor, welcomes and exacerbates. Clinton had begun his second term in office vowing to be the “repairer of the breach,” and, if he did not do that, Clinton did express contrition and remorse, which he may or may not have felt, on the eve of his impeachment. He vowed to move on.

That is not Donald Trump’s way. Minutes after Pelosi banged down the gavel on his impeachment, the President was onstage in Michigan, musing out loud about the late, legendary Michigan representative John Dingell looking up from hell as his wife, Debbie Dingell, voted with the Democrats to impeach. Trump will never say that he is sorry, and his supporters will never demand it of him. On the House floor, Barry Loudermilk, a little-known Trump devotee from Georgia, actually claimed that Trump was being treated worse than Jesus had been by the Roman prefect who ordered his execution. This was laughable, but in some ways the Republicans were almost all Barry Loudermilks on Wednesday, endorsing an array of fanciful excuses for the President that were just as implausible, if not so comically ahistorical. It was McCarthyism, a day that would live in infamy, like Pearl Harbor, they said. Trump never demanded that Ukraine investigate his political rival Joe Biden. Trump is a noble anti-corruption crusader.

The fight now heads to the Senate, where the Republican majority is expected to offer another all but unanimous G.O.P. vote to acquit Trump, following a trial that has little prospect of featuring a single witness. Pelosi, in fact, hinted, on Wednesday night, that she is not ready to send over the articles of impeachment just yet; “we’ll see,” she said, whether Republicans in the other chamber are really ready to have a fair trial. But, whenever a Senate trial happens, it’s certain that Trump will claim complete and total vindication from it, and that Democrats will blame Senate Republicans for failing to hold him to account. With the result in so little suspense, Washington has been consumed in recent days by the politics of this presumed outcome, reading the latest batch of polls as if they were runes from the future that can reveal how this all plays out in the 2020 election. But that is, as yet, unknowable. For now, what the polls show is exactly what Wednesday’s impeachment debate showed: the stubborn, unyielding reality of a country divided, of an America whose views are fixed about Trump and about everything else."
https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/07/politics/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-2020-democratic-primary/index.html,"Interviews like the one Sanders gave to Cooper on Monday night suggest that he won't make that mistake again. (Sidebar: Campaigns -- all campaigns -- are about choices between candidates. Highlighting your strengths is of value, yes. But so too is noting your opponents' weaknesses -- and why they should matter to voters.)
Sanders has clearly read up on Biden's looooong voting record -- supported the invasion of Iraq, backed NAFTA, advocated for a bankruptcy bill -- and is beginning to roll out the clear contrast between the former vice president's record on those issues and his own. (Sanders is helped in all of this because he was in the Senate contemporaneously with Biden and can point to moments where the two differed.) The next question for Sanders will be whether he puts these critiques in television ads in places like Iowa and New Hampshire as the votes in both of those states near.
Whether Sanders continues to take the case to Biden remains to be seen. Ditto whether he will wind up as the Democratic nominee. But what is less ambiguous is that Sanders is in far better position to become the Democratic standard-bearer than most people -- including most Democrats -- expected him to be even as recently as last fall. And the Iowa caucuses are only 27(!!) days away."

""Violent gang activity, such as extortion, violent street crime, rape, and narcotics and human trafficking, is widespread.""
Over the past year, the administration has rolled out a series of policies intended to curtail people from claiming asylum in the United States. Many of those changes targeted Central Americans, who were increasingly coming to the US-Mexico border to claim asylum.
However, as the number of Central Americans arriving at the US southern border declined in recent months, the administration has become increasingly concerned with an increase in Mexican nationals illegally crossing into the US."
https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/03/opinions/trump-biggest-foreign-policy-crisis-yet-bergen/index.html,"A consistent theme of Donald Trump's presidency is how the seemingly endless post-9/11 wars in the greater Middle East have wasted trillions of dollars.
Trump believes he was elected, in part, to draw down from these wars -- and in the past year he has done just that, both in Afghanistan and in Syria.
Then came Thursday's air strike, ordered by Trump, that killed arguably the most important commander in the Middle East, the Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani.

As global affairs analyst Max Boot pointed out Friday on CNN, the US has not killed a senior military leader of another country since 1943, when it shot down the plane carrying Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the mastermind of Pearl Harbor.
This represents a serious escalation of the long-simmering confrontation between the United States and Iran, since Soleimani was effectively the leader of Iran's armed forces.
Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has vowed to avenge Soleimani's death.
And given Iran's proxies across the Middle East -- from Lebanon to Iraq, from Syria to Yemen -- as well Iran's substantial military and ballistic missile capabilities, it's a threat that must be taken seriously.
Indeed, on Friday, the United States urged the evacuation of all US citizens from Iraq immediately.


And Trump now faces what is likely the most significant foreign policy crisis of his presidency -- part of which he has created for himself.
To paraphrase Leon Trotsky: You may not be interested in the wars of the Middle East, but those wars are interested in you.
But Trump is not the first American president to learn how difficult it can be to fully extricate the US from the region.
President Jimmy Carter was confronted by the hostage crisis at the US embassy in Tehran that helped contribute to his one-term presidency.
President Ronald Reagan had to pull back from Lebanon after 241 US servicemen were killed in Beirut by a truck bombing in 1983 that was mounted by the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia.
And Reagan's presidency was nearly derailed by the harebrained Iran-Contra scheme to swap arms with Iran in return for American and European hostages that were held by Hezbollah in Lebanon.

President George H.W. Bush had to respond to Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 that seemed to also threaten neighboring Saudi Arabia by sending hundreds of thousands of American soldiers to expel Saddam from Kuwait.
Bill Clinton's presidency saw the rise of al Qaeda. On Clinton's watch, the terrorist group bombed two US embassies in Africa, killing more than two hundred people in 1998.
Two years later, the group attacked the USS Cole in Yemen, killing 17 American sailors.
9/11 was one of the hinge events of American history. As a result, President George W. Bush launched a war in Afghanistan against al Qaeda and the Taliban -- and also a war of choice two years later in Iraq.
President Barack Obama dramatically increased the covert CIA drone campaign targeting al Qaeda in Pakistan and in Yemen.

Obama also oversaw the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq in 2011. Three years later, after ISIS was almost at the gates of Baghdad, Obama sent thousands of American troops back into Iraq to combat the terrorist army.
Trump's natural inclination is to get out of the Middle East, but just like every other American president over the past four decades, he is now being pulled back in. Indeed, Trump himself has contributed to this crisis by pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal.
On October 3, 2017, Trump's then-Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that Iran was adhering to the nuclear agreement. When Sen. Angus King, an independent, asked Mattis whether he believed the deal was in US national security interests, Mattis replied, ""Yes, Senator, I do.""
But Trump had asserted for the past two years that the Iran agreement was the ""worst deal ever,"" and so in 2018 he pulled out of the deal. He also added new sanctions that have devastated the Iranian economy and contributed to widespread street protests against the regime.
Iran announced in July that it was breaching the terms of the nuclear deal by enriching uranium beyond the 3.67% purity allowed by the agreement, enriching it above 4.5%.
This was still a very long way from the 90% purity that would be needed for a nuclear weapon, but it was a small step down the road to reactivating Iran's nuclear weapons program -- the program that Trump had repeatedly said he would never allow.
Since June, Iran has been punching back in other ways, bringing down an unmanned US surveillance drone and allegedly attacking some of the world's most important oil facilities in Saudi Arabia (an attack it denies carrying out), while Iran-backed militias have also attacked American bases in Iraq.
Now the United States and Iran stand on the brink of a war that neither side really wants, but Iran likely feels it must respond in a meaningful way to the killing of Soleimani.
As a result, both sides may go up the ""escalatory ladder"" to a wider conflict.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/07/media/oval-office-meeting-trump-saudi-arabia/index.html," 
The White House faced sharp criticism from journalists on Tuesday after they learned that an Oval Office meeting between President Trump and Saudi Vice Minister of Defense Khalid bin Salman had not been publicly disclosed.
The public only learned about the Monday meeting between the two leaders after a statement and photos were released by Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Deputy Minister of Defense Khalid bin Salman, arrives at the Department of State for a meeting with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on January 06, 2020 in Washington, DC.
""A meeting with a foreign leader in the Oval Office should, at the very least, be on the public schedule with a read-out of the meeting released after it is over,"" Jon Karl, the president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said in a statement. ""This has been the long-standing precedent for presidents of both political parties.""
Karl added, ""It is disturbing to see the government of Saudi Arabia have more transparency than the White House about a meeting with the President in the Oval Office.""
Bin Salman, who is the younger brother of the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, tweeted Tuesday morning that during the meeting he and Trump reviewed ""aspects of our bilateral cooperation, including efforts to confront regional an international challenges.""


Upon directives from HRH the Crown Prince, I had the pleasure of meeting with @RealDonaldTrump yesterday to deliver a message from the Crown Prince, and review aspects of our bilateral cooperation, including efforts to confront regional and international challenges.

Saudi Arabia is a key US ally in the Middle East where tensions have escalated in recent days after a US drone strike ordered by President Trump killed the top Iranian commander, Qasem Soleimani.
Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, did not immediately respond to questions about why the meeting was not publicly disclosed.
A formal readout of the meeting has still not been released by the White House, as is customary when the President meets with a foreign leader.
Trump, however, tweeted after the meeting had become public, describing it as ""very good.""
""We discussed Trade, Military, Oil Prices, Security, and Stability in the Middle East!"" Trump said in his tweet."
https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/07/politics/donald-trump-jr-hillary-clinton-rifle/index.html,"A photo of President Donald Trump's oldest son smiling while holding a semi-automatic rifle bearing medieval symbols and a cartoon of Hillary Clinton behind bars drew swift attention over the weekend, with hate group researchers pointing out that the medieval symbols have been embraced by extremist groups.

Donald Trump Jr. posted the photo Sunday on Instagram with a nod in the caption to the controversial design, which included a Crusader Cross -- also known as a Jerusalem Cross -- and helmet on the lower receiver, as well as a magazine featuring the image of the former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee.
""Nice day at the range. @rarebreedfirearms and @spikes_tactical adding a little extra awesome to my AR and that mag,"" Trump Jr. wrote, tagging the companies that design and sell the gun.
While symbols and references to the Crusades still hold religious and historical significance -- the Crusader Cross is included on the flag of the country Georgia -- far right groups have seized upon them, using them to represent an anti-Muslim ideology, according to the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, two organizations that study hate groups.
A spokesman for Trump denied on Monday that the symbol on the gun, named by its manufacturer the Crusader Rifle, carried a white supremacist meaning and cited its presence on the Georgian flag and on a medal bestowed by the Pope.
""Symbols on firearms depicting various historical warriors are extremely common within the 2nd Amendment community. Don's Instagram post was strictly about him using a famous meme to mock Hillary Clinton, as he and many others have done on numerous occasions and will surely do again in the future, so long as it continues triggering humorless liberals,"" Trump spokesman Andy Surabian told CNN.
An avid hunter, Trump has posted other images of himself with weapons on his social media feeds. His affinity for controversial memes has helped bolster his own popularity among a Republican Party reshaped by his father.
History of the symbols
Symbols and references to the Crusades -- the Middle Ages campaign by Christian armies to reclaim the Muslim-controlled Holy Land -- have circulated for years inside the far right movement, making appearances in a manifesto written by a far-right gunman who killed dozens in Norway in 2011.
""The adoption of these symbols is meant largely as a way of signaling anti-Muslim sentiment in particular, but also this notion that Christianity needs to retake western civilization,"" said Howard Graves, a senior research analyst at the SPLC.
The gun companies that make and sell the Crusader rifle say it was inspired by history.
Rare Breed Firearms -- the manufacturer of the gun -- did not respond to a request for comment, but says on their website that the design was ""inspired by some of the most fierce warriors who fought in nearly 200 years of epic conflicts known as the Crusades.""
""This lower honors the warrior mindset. Technology evolves, warriors never change,"" the company wrote.
In an email, the CEO of Spike's Tactical -- the Florida company that sells the Crusader gun -- said that the gun and another AR with a Spartan helmet on it that they sell were ""referencing famed historical soldiers"" and are of a design that are ""common among gun manufacturers, popular with gun owners throughout the country and have nothing to do with political ideology.""
""It's objectively silly and dishonest for leftwing groups, like the SPLC, to claim that this symbol on our Crusader model has anything to do with hate or an extremist ideology. In other words, these people have no idea what they're talking about and should apologize for their outrageous smears,"" Cole Leleux, the CEO, said.
Spike's Tactical drew criticism in 2015 when they sold another AR model that a company spokesman told news outlets at the time was built to ensure it ""would never be able to be used by Muslim terrorists to kill innocent people or advance their radical agenda.""
That gun, also called the Crusader, featured an etching of a Bible verse as well as the Latin phrase ""Deus Vult,"" another medieval term meaning ""God wills it"" that has recently become a rallying cry for white supremacists, according to hate group researchers.
Dan Zimmerman, the managing editor of The Truth About Guns, a website about firearms with a pro-gun leaning, told CNN that adorning guns with symbols is not common, but called it a ""niche design that some people find attractive.""
""There are all kinds of designs for AR lowers, from skulls to Sparta helmets,"" Zimmerman said.
A spokesman for the ADL, Jake Hyman, said the Sparta helmet symbol has also been co-opted by some right-wing extremists, and symbols like the Crusader Cross have recently been used to deface mosques in the US, according to Graves. The man accused of killing scores of Muslims at prayer in Christchurch, New Zealand, last year inscribed his weapons with references to the Crusades.
When white supremacists appeared in the Charlottesville march with shields bearing a red cross and the words ""Deus Vult,""a coalition of Medieval scholars groups denounced what they called an ""appropriation"" of medieval symbols in a ""fantasy of a pure, white Europe that bears no relationship to reality.""
""As scholars of the medieval world we are disturbed by the use of a nostalgic but inaccurate myth of the Middle Ages by racist movements in the United States,"" the groups wrote.
White supremacist voices have gained prominence in recent years, with analysts like the ADL and SPLC pointing to the President's refusal to condemn racial violence by alt-right protesters at a 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as emboldening the movement.
After wide blowback to his remarks on Charlottesville, Trump later called neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups ""repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans"" and a month later, he signed a resolution condemning white supremacy."
https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/11/politics/arrests-brazilian-migrants-spiked-2019-border-surge/index.html,"The number of Brazilians arrested by US Border Patrol nationwide spiked this past year to around 18,000, up from approximately 1,600 the year prior, according to data provided by Customs and Border Protection and historical data.
The number of arrests far surpassed any year going back to 2007. The previous high was around 3,200 in fiscal year 2016, based on available data. The uptick in Brazilians entering the US illegally came amid an overall surge of migrants arriving at the southern border driven in large part by Central American migrant families heading to the US.
Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said Tuesday during a briefing at the State Department's Foreign Press Center that the US is in ""ongoing discussions"" with Brazil over a growing number of its nationals arriving at the US-Mexico border.
During the first two months of fiscal year 2020 -- October and November -- just over 3,000 Brazilians were apprehended by Border Patrol, keeping on pace with last year's numbers.

""We do have an open dialogue with them. Immigration issues continue to be discussed actively with Brazil. I will note that we are seeing more Brazilians show up at the southern border and that's increasing the intensity on the US side to that part of the challenge that we're facing right now,"" Cuccinelli said in response to a question about whether the US plans to strike an agreement with Brazil similar to the one with Guatemala.
In recent months, the administration has been in discussions with the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to send migrants seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border to those countries. In November, the Trump administration sent the first migrant to Guatemala as part of its agreement with the country to accept asylum-seeking migrants from the US.
The policies rolled out this past year to deter migrants from approaching the US-Mexico border have largely excluded Brazilians.
Overall, more than 850,000 migrants were apprehended on the southern border in 2019. There was an increase in migrants from South American countries, particularly Brazil, as well as Ecuador and Venezuela, according to the new data.
In fiscal year 2019, Border Patrol apprehended 13,198 Ecuadorians, compared with 1,613 in 2018. There were 2,257 Venezuelans apprehended this past year, up from 126 the year prior.
Neither Customs and Border Protection nor the Department of Homeland Security provided additional details or analysis on the reason behind the spike in these arrests.
Paulo Sotero, director of the Wilson Center's Brazil Institute, told CNN that Brazil has faced economic woes for years, with high unemployment and low growth, leading to an ongoing migration to the US.
""This is a country, even in times like this, when you have a leader talking about building walls, is the country most attractive to immigrants in the world, illegal or legal,"" he said about migration to the US.
The 2018 Brazilian presidential election, which elevated Jair Bolsonaro, was an important event, said Sotero, given that the new government made unfulfilled promises about creating economic opportunities and opening up markets.
Bolsonaro's win came amid a prolonged recession, rising crime rates and widespread corruption scandals and followed one of the most polarizing and violent political campaigns in Brazil's history.

ICE arrests dropped in the past year amid southern border crisis
Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan said Monday that the administration's focus last year was on addressing the surge in families from Northern Triangle countries. However, he said, the agency is also monitoring an increase in Mexican families, as well as arrivals of migrants from Brazil, Haiti and African countries.
Smugglers and cartels are ""constantly modifying their approach to continue to make money and exploit migrants from everywhere,"" said Morgan.
Morgan also said the agency was considering expanding the Migration Protection Protocols program, also known as ""Remain in Mexico,"" to additional demographic populations. The program allows the administration to send migrants to Mexico while they await their immigration court proceedings in the US.
Only migrants from Spanish-speaking countries have been enrolled in the program, therefore Brazilians have been excluded, according to a DHS source.
""We're confident that the kind of same approach and same initiatives that we are applying with Northern Triangle countries' families, specifically, that we're going to be able to apply those same initiatives with other demographics as well,"" said Morgan.

The House voted Tuesday to approve the nearly $1.4 trillion spending deal that includes $12.5 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and $12.5 million for the National Institutes of Health. The funding comes as the nation continues to grapple with the effects of frequent mass shootings.


""With this investment, the best public health researchers in the country will be put to work to identify ways to reduce injury and death due to firearms,"" Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey, the chair of the House Appropriations Committee who secured the funding in the spending bill, said in a statement.
The provision maintains the long-standing prohibition on any funds being used to advocate or promote gun control.
Now that the spending deal has cleared the House, it will need to be approved by the Senate before it can go to President Donald Trump for his expected signature.
""We applaud Congress for finally providing the critical funding we have been requesting,"" Dr. Georges C. Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said in a statement Monday. ""This will support public health research that is essential to answering questions about the best ways to reduce the morbidity and mortality from firearms in the United States.""
Dr. Robert McLean, the president of the American College of Physicians, applauded the funding bill and said in a statement that ""the alarming rate of injuries and deaths related to firearms brings to light the glaring lack of research and data.""
""For over twenty years, we've desperately needed up-to-date research about firearm violence and intervention and prevention strategies to reduce physical as well as emotional injuries caused by firearms,"" McLean said.
""While $25 million is a great start, it pales in comparison to the amount needed to address this public health problem,"" said Dr. Joseph Sakran, the founder of This Is Our Lane, a movement started by physicians in response to the National Rifle Association.
For more than two decades, the CDC has avoided firearms research because of its interpretation of the so-called Dickey Amendment, named after the late Republican Rep. Jay Dickey of Arkansas.
In 1996, Congress passed the Dickey Amendment and removed $2.6 million — the amount the CDC spent on gun research the year prior — from the CDC's budget.
While the legislation doesn't explicitly ban federal research funds from being used for research related to gun violence, it states, ""none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.""
The amendment had a chilling effect on gun research at the CDC as the agency held back to avoid losing further funding.
But before he passed away in 2017, Dickey reversed his position and urged the government to carry out research on gun violence.
The National Rifle Association has argued that the amendment itself didn't prevent gun violence research — only advocacy — and therefore does not need any changes.
Last year, Congress passed a spending bill accompanied by language giving a green light to the CDC to research gun violence — although there was no money specifically budgeted for the research.
""While appropriations language prohibits the CDC and other agencies from using appropriated funding to advocate or promote gun control, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has stated the CDC has the authority to conduct research on the causes of gun violence,"" the accompanying instructions stated, referring to Secretary Alex Azar's 2018 comments to Congress.
The Democratic-controlled House in February passed a universal background checks bill, HR 8, which would require background checks on all firearm sales in the country. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he will not bring any gun bill to the Senate for a vote unless Trump says he would sign it into law.

https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/06/politics/judge-judy-michael-bloomberg-endorsement/index.html,"Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday received a glowing judgment from the presiding judge of TV's most popular courtroom: Judith Sheindlin, aka ""Judge Judy,"" who threw her support behind his White House bid.
""I like to say you can judge someone's character by what they've done. Mike Bloomberg has done amazing things and will be a truly great president,"" Sheindlin said in a new campaign ad. ""No one comes close to Mike Bloomberg's executive achievement, government experience, and impactful philanthropy.""
""His steady leadership will unite our country and bring us through these very challenging times.""
The 30-second ad, titled ""Judge Him,"" features Sheindlin, a New York native who has become a television icon due to her long-running daytime court show. The spot is slated to run ""across digital channels and in relevant broadcast programming across 26 states,"" according to a press release issued by Bloomberg's campaign.
Sheindlin suggested that while President Donald Trump had not de-escalated lingering tensions from the 2016 election, Democrats had not reacted well or prepared for a future face-off.
""I do think that the President had the capacity to calm down the rhetoric,"" she said, adding that ""many people were disappointed on that election night in November, and some, other than the President, reacted, I think, badly.""
She continued, ""The last three years should have been spent finding the best possible candidate to run against him. If you lose a race, you're supposed to spend the next couple of years training for that race.""
The Bloomberg campaign said Sheindlin has never before endorsed a presidential candidate but was ""outspoken"" in her support for the former mayor prior to his late entry to the race. In a USA Today op-ed penned in October, the judge touted Bloomberg's business experience and focus on climate change and gun control, among other things.
""We need a no-nonsense president who's sane, competent and honest, someone who can't be bought and has no skin in the game,"" she wrote in the piece.
Bloomberg, a moderate who entered the race in November, has cast himself as a problem solver on the campaign trail. Since announcing his run, the billionaire has focused on expensive ad buys and building a robust general election operation with top political strategists.

https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/01/politics/john-kerry-climate-change/index.html,"Former Secretary of State John Kerry on Sunday said that ""no country is getting the job done"" when it comes to taking action on climate change and that the US and other nations are ""way behind"" on curbing the crisis.
""There are great efforts out there, many environmental groups, young people particularly, but no country is getting the job done. I mean the simple reality is that we are way behind, way behind the eight ball,"" he told NBC's Chuck Todd on ""Meet The Press."" ""Things are getting worse, not better.""
He continued: ""So we have our unlikely allies coming together here. There is no group that has people as diverse as ours in terms of nationality, age, gender, ideology, background, life experience, and all of these people have to come together saying, 'We've got to treat this like a war.' It has to require decision making and organization and efforts that are just not taking place.""


Kerry -- who is launching World War Zero, an initiative with a mission of ""making the world respond to the climate crisis the same way we mobilized to win World War II"" -- joins others in warning about the climate threat ahead of a United Nations conference on climate change that runs from December 2-13 in Madrid. Other notable founding members include actor and former California Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Democratic President Bill Clinton, former Obama administration Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Ohio GOP Gov. John Kasich, former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams and Cindy McCain, widow of the late Republican Sen. John McCain and chairwoman of the McCain Institute's board of trustees.
On Saturday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she was leading a delegation of Democratic lawmakers to the UN COP25 to ""combat the existential threat of our time: climate crisis.""
""Taking action to protect our planet is a public health decision for clean air and clean water for our children, an economic decision for creating the green, good-paying jobs of the future, a national security decision to address resource competition and climate migration and also a moral decision to be good stewards of God's creation and pass a sustainable, healthy planet to the next generation,"" she said in a statement.
The State Department announced Saturday that it will send a deputy assistant secretary to lead US officials from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture and the Treasury Department to the summit.
The Trump administration has steadily worked to roll back Obama-era environmental regulations that aim to limit air and water pollution and stem the impacts of climate change, and officials announced last month that the administration had notified the UN to officially begin the US exit from the Paris climate accord, a landmark agreement to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases.
Kerry, who served as secretary of state under President Barack Obama, has criticized President Donald Trump on climate, saying Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has ""offered more leadership"" on the issue ""in one day or in one week"" compared to the President.
Earlier this year, Kerry co-signed a letter sent by former national security officials to the President expressing concerns about how the administration was handling the crisis.

https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/politics/democratic-attorneys-general-association-abortion/index.html,"The group for state Democratic attorneys general issued a warning to potential candidates on Monday -- back abortion rights, or we won't back you.
The Democratic Attorneys General Association announced that it would only endorse candidates who support abortion access and publicly vow to defend reproductive rights, a requirement the group called ""first-of-its-kind for any Democratic campaign committee.""
The move comes with 12 attorneys general seats at play in 2020, according to the group, and as state attorneys general have played a key role in litigating the recent fights over abortion rights at both the state and national levels.
Defending the recent crop of conservative state-level restrictions to the procedure has fallen largely to states attorneys general. Meanwhile, representatives from liberal states' attorneys general's offices have brought or supported several of the challenges to the Trump administration's efforts to restrict access to the procedure.
The experts at Mubadala 2019 predicted the tech world is shifting eastwards - this is why.

""As the battle for reproductive rights unfolds at the ballot box, in statehouses, and courtrooms across this country, there is no group of elected officials better positioned to lead the fight for our rights than state Attorneys General,"" said Ellen Rosenblum, the group's co-chair and Oregon attorney general, in a statement. ""That is why electing Democratic AGs who are committed to protecting reproductive freedom, especially for the most vulnerable communities, has never been more important.""
The requirement would apply to potential funding, digital resources and strategic partners from the group starting in the 2020 elections. While there is currently only one anti-abortion-rights attorney general in the group -- Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood -- he lost a bid for the governorship earlier this month and will be succeeded by Republican Lynn Fitch in January.
The group's communications director, Lizzie Ulmer, said that the policy change had been in the works for some time, but had become a more serious focus since May, when Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed the state's six-week abortion ban.
""It ended up being that this was the right timing,"" she told CNN. ""The AGs really wanted this to happen, and they were really excited that this was something the committee would be able to do.""
Planned Parenthood acting President Alexis McGill Johnson praised the group's new policy.
""Attorneys general are some of the most important people protecting our ability to access sexual and reproductive health care — including abortion,"" she said in a statement. ""Every party should support our right to access health care. This shouldn't be a Democratic or a Republican value. This is fundamental.""
NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue said that the move ""could not come at a more important moment.""
""The Republican party is waging an all-out assault against women and pregnant people, and voters have to know someone has our backs in this crucial moment,"" Hogue said in a statement. ""Now, we know that Democratic Attorneys General do.""
The group's announcement included a video featuring New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democratic attorney general who has successfully helped push back on national efforts to restrict abortion access.
Earlier this month, a federal judge in New York blocked the Department of Health and Human Services' so-called conscience rule -- which lets health care workers who cite moral or religious reasons opt out of providing certain medical procedures, such as abortion, sterilization and assisted suicide -- in a challenge brought by New York and several other states. New York is also leading, along with Oregon, a lawsuit against another department rule prohibiting taxpayer-funded family planning clinics from discussing abortion with patients or referring patients to abortion providers.
""The fight to protect women's reproductive rights is far from over,"" James said in a statement. ""Especially in this current political climate, where a woman's right to make her own decisions about her own body is under relentless assault, we must persist and redouble our efforts. That's why as Democratic Attorneys General, we are taking a clear stand on the issue ensuring that we elect Attorneys General to our team who share our pro-choice values.""
Both critics and supporters of the announcement highlighted the impacts of the policy going forward.
Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion-rights group Susan B. Anthony List, slammed the new policy, saying that it ""underscores the extremism of the modern Democratic Party on abortion.""
""Democratic Party power brokers send a clear message that voters (with concerns about legal abortion) are unwelcome,"" she said, adding that ""in contrast to President Trump's strong pro-life leadership, abortion extremism will be a serious political liability in 2020.""
Some Democratic presidential candidates cheered the move.
""Attorneys General stand on the front lines of the fight to protect access to abortion and reproductive rights—and I stand with @DemocraticAGs,"" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted. ""Thank you for making this commitment to defend our rights.""
California Sen. Kamala Harris tweeted, ""The times we live in requires bold action. Attorneys General play a critical role in blocking abortion bans and I applaud @DemocraticAGs for taking a stand to ensure reproductive rights are protected.""

https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/07/politics/bernie-sanders-immigration-plan/index.html,"Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday released his comprehensive immigration plan, calling for a complete restructuring of the system through legislative action and a series of executive orders.

On day one of his administration, the candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination said, he would place a moratorium on deportations, end raids by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, stop construction of the wall on the US-Mexico border, end family separations and shutter for-profit detention centers.
Under his ""A Welcoming and Safe America for All"" plan, the Vermont independent indicated for the first time that he will reverse guidance from the Trump administration's Department of Justice and permit asylum claims from those fleeing domestic or gang violence. Sanders would also overturn Trump's so-called ""public charge"" rule and ensure that immigrants are not discriminated against based on income or disability, while extending temporary protected status until more permanent resolutions are in place, invalidating Trump's efforts to end those designations.

In his proposal, Sanders expands on his support for extending legal status to the 1.8 million young people who are currently eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and pledging to provide relief to their parents, as then-President Barack Obama sought to do, by using executive authority to allow undocumented immigrants who have lived in the country for at least five years to be free from deportation.

The plan also looks to make broad, immediate and overarching changes to the current immigration system by restructuring the Department of Homeland Security. Sanders would fold ICE into the Justice Department and Customs and Border Protection into the Treasury Department.
""Putting everything in one basket under DHS has not just not worked out, and it is what has allowed Trump and company to weaponize immigration in a racist way,"" Sanders senior adviser Jeff Weaver told CNN. ""Instead of treating everything immigration-related the same, we break up the parts where it makes sense to do that, so given ICE's federal law enforcement function, moving it to the Justice Department is incredibly important.""

Sanders said he would seek to strengthen immigrant labor rights by prioritizing the interests of immigrants and workers in trade negotiations. Additionally, the proposal suggests creating a whistleblower visa that would allow immigrants to report illegal actions without fear of retribution and ensure that all domestic and farm workers are paid $15 an hour.
Issues surrounding the effects of climate change, and the dislocation it causes, are central to the Sanders immigration plan. Under the proposal, the government would create a program to welcome migrants displaced by climate change and would set a goal of accepting at least 50,000 of them during his first year in office.
Joining former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, who catapulted this issue onto the debate stage back in June, Sanders would downgrade crossing the border without documentation to a civil offense from a federal crime.
At a town hall in Oskaloosa, Iowa, in April, Sanders was asked if his positions on immigration meant he was for open borders.

""That's not my thing. I think what we need is simply comprehensive immigration reform,"" he said in response to an audience question. ""There's a lot of poverty in this world, people from all over the world. And I don't think that's something we can do at this point. That's not my position.""
Sanders often refers to his father's migration to the United States and how it affected his outlook and upbringing on the campaign trail.
""I know who I am and where I came from,"" Sanders said at a recent rally in Minneapolis, where he appeared with Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, reprising a line from his first official campaign rally in Brooklyn, New York.
Weaver described the issue of immigration as a deeply personal concern for Sanders.
""I remember in some early, private meetings he had in 2015 with young undocumented people, he came away so moved, and the connection that was created between him and those young immigrants has really been enduring and what motivates his desire to see this inhumane immigration system to be reformed,"" Weaver told CNN.
""Those meetings were some of the most personally moving for him in my time with him."""
https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/05/politics/plastic-straws-2020-culture-war/index.html,"There's a new cultural flashpoint in the 2020 presidential race: plastic straws.
Sen. Kamala Harris of California says the straws, which contribute to plastic pollution in oceans, should be banned -- but she admits she doesn't like the paper straws some restaurant chains and cities have started using as an alternative.
President Donald Trump's reelection campaign is turning it into a gimmick -- mocking Harris and other Democrats as it sells its own Trump-branded plastic straws.
And Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is calling the whole thing a sideshow meant to distract from the larger issue of overhauling the energy industry and forcing corporations to reduce emissions.
The elevation of an issue that is on the far margins of the climate challenge, but is tangible to people across the country, captures the tension between tackling the crisis and the changes that doing so would bring to Americans' everyday lives.
The cultural clash comes in part because, on broader policy matters, there is no middle ground to be found between Democrats advocating urgent action to address the climate crisis and Trump, a climate science denier.
The President has repeatedly said he doesn't believe humans play a role in global warming. Last year, he dismissed a study by his own administration warning of the potential catastrophic consequences of climate change by saying, ""I don't believe it.""
Through a seven-hour marathon of town halls hosted by CNN on Wednesday night, the top-10-polling Democratic presidential candidates laid out far-reaching plans to spend trillions of dollars to remake America's energy industry, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution from construction and agriculture, rejoin the Paris climate accord and push for increased international commitments to reduce emissions.
They were also asked about changes to Americans' daily habits, such as whether they should stop using plastic straws -- some cities, including Seattle and Washington, have banned them -- to reduce plastic pollution, and whether they should cut back on eating meat.
""We do need to ban the plastic,"" Harris said.
The questions came the same day the Trump administration announced it would roll back requirements for energy-saving light bulbs.
Warren mocked the focus on everyday items -- as opposed to the corporations responsible for the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions -- when asked about the move.
""Oh, come on. Give me a break,"" she said, adding that she is not in favor of government control of things like straws and meat consumption.
""Look, there are a lot of ways that we try to change our energy consumption, and our pollution, and God bless all of those ways,"" she said. ""Some of it is with light bulbs, some of it is on straws, some of it, dang, is on cheeseburgers, right? There are a lot of different pieces to this. And I get that people are trying to find the part that they can work on and what can they do. And I'm in favor of that. And I'm going to help and I'm going to support.""
""But understand, this is exactly what the fossil fuel industry hopes we're all talking about,"" she added. ""That's what they want us to talk about.""
On CNN Thursday morning, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said the focus on straws and burgers comes in part because, for average Americans, ""facing just how colossal of a challenge this is ... can feel paralyzing.""
""See, right now we're in a mode where we're thinking of it mostly through the perspective of guilt, from using a straw to eating a burger. Am I part of the problem? In a certain way, yes. But the most exciting thing is that we can all be part of the solution,"" he said.
Trump's reelection campaign, meanwhile, is bashing Democrats for the ways in which combating climate change could lead to minor annoyances in Americans' lives: soggy paper straws and fewer cheeseburgers.
His website offers 10-packs of plastic straws with Trump's name on them for $15.
Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale on Wednesday night tweeted: ""Kamala Harris just said she wants to BAN plastic straws -- the only kind that actually work!""
On Twitter, Republicans working for Trump's campaign and congressional committees have selectively edited the comments from Warren to characterize them as favoring government control of straws and burgers.
The campaign's official ""Trump War Room"" Twitter account tweeted a trimmed Warren clip and said: ""Elizabeth Warren and the radical Green New Deal Democrats have their eyes set on Americans' straws, cheeseburgers, and light bulbs to 'change our energy consumption.' ""
The Trump campaign's Warren video cut out the portion in which she minimized the importance of straws, burgers and light bulbs and called them ""exactly what the fossil fuel industry hopes we're all talking about."" A spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee tweeted the same falsehood, claiming Warren had said she was in favor of the government controlling consumption of those items, when she had not.
Another Trump-affiliated Twitter account retweeted pictures of supporters with their plastic Trump straws.
The Team Trump account also highlighted Harris' moment when she said it was difficult to drink out of paper straws.
""Democrats want to BAN plastic straws. Paper straws don't work! Get your TRUMP STRAWS before Democrats try to take them away!"" the account tweeted.

https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/03/politics/julian-castro-climate-plan/index.html,"Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro released on Tuesday his plan to combat climate change, outlining the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate's approach to what he calls the ""greatest existential threat to our future"" ahead of his appearance at CNN's climate crisis town hall on Wednesday in New York.
Castro's plan -- titled ""People and Planet First Plan"" -- aims to ""direct $10 trillion in federal, state, local, and private investments"" over the next 10 years. The Castro campaign estimates that the influx of investment will create 10 million jobs over a decade.
But Castro's plan also focuses on the racial impacts of climate change, citing a series of studies that found those most directly impacted by issues like toxic waste, asthma and pollution are more likely to be people of color and more vulnerable communities.
""This crisis is the greatest existential threat to our future, but we have the power to mobilize the greatness of America,"" Castro writes.
Castro also outlines a detailed timeline for how the United States will move toward carbon neutrality. By 2030, the Castro campaign states, all coal-generated electricity will be phased out and replaced by zero-emission sources and all new light and medium duty vehicles will be zero-emissions. Those standards increase over the next decade: By 2045, the United States will be net-zero emissions and by 2050, Castro forecasts, the world will be net-zero carbon emissions, led by the United States.
A campaign spokesman said the plan would be paid for with a new carbon pollution fee, a restart of the Superfund tax and making ""polluters pay."" Additionally, the proposed programs would have revenue, the spokesman said. Finally, previous proposed taxes -- the inheritance tax and wealth inequality tax -- would help pay for the plan, as well as the eliminating the Trump tax cuts.
The 10 candidates who have qualified for September's debate hosted by the Democratic National Committee will gather on Wednesday in New York for a series of climate change town halls hosted by CNN. The issue has been central in the 2020 Democratic primary, with polls regularly ranking climate change among the top concerns for the country.
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who dropped out in August after failing to garner enough support in the polls to qualify for the September debates, ran almost entirely on combatting climate change and pushed the other candidates on the issue throughout his Democratic bid.
Castro's plan mimics some of what Inslee proposed earlier this year and a Castro aide told CNN that his team spoke with Inslee's policy team about the plan.
Castro also pledged if he is elected president to create a National Climate Council, an organization that would coordinate the federal government's response to climate change; invest $200 billion in a Green Infrastructure Fund to ""invest in physical infrastructure such as smart grids and electric vehicle charging stations,"" and -- in a bid to combat deforestation -- plant 30 billion trees by 2050, or roughly 1 billion trees as year.
While Castro's plan focuses on the technical aspects of fighting climate change -- for example, he proposes the United States ""immediately stop the exploration and extraction of fossil fuels on public lands and end all taxpayer subsidies of fossil fuel production"" -- the presidential candidate also proposes an increased focused on how climate change most impacts vulnerable communities.
""The problem is that, like our neighborhoods, pollution is segregated,"" Castro writes in his proposal, noting a 2007 study that found more than half of the 9 million people living close to hazardous waste were black.
Castro states in the plan that within his first 100 days, he will ""propose new civil rights legislation to address the disparate impact of environmental discrimination and dismantle structures of environmental racism.""
""In my administration, we will invest in environmental justice and climate resilience with an emphasis on frontline communities,"" Castro writes, ""people who are at the forefront of combating climate change, and families who have borne the unequal burden of pollution.""

https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/14/politics/us-britain-politics-boris-johnson-donald-trump-labour-party-democrats-election-2020/index.html,"The Labour Party's wipeout in Britain's election spelled out an undeniable warning to Democrats over the potential dangers of tracking too far to the left of more moderate national electorates.
But it also highlighted a more profound parallel in the often synergistic US and UK politics that potentially poses longer-term threats to progressive parties: culturally and politically, they have lost touch with their heartland working-class voters -- the very people they were set up to represent.
The most significant warning for Democrats from Jeremy Corbyn's disaster may be that when a party gets consumed by its own ideological debate, it risks losing sight of subtle changes in its own base.
Conservative Party leader Boris Johnson picked up a haul of seats across Labour strongholds and won the support of the opposition party's traditional base -- blue collar, unionized industrial workers. As the results were rolling in on Thursday night, it looked a lot like US election night in 2016 as a Trump wave swept across the former Democratic rust belt power base in the Midwest.
In the UK, as in the US, such constituencies had suffered economic blight for decades -- ironically, many from liberalizing economic reforms introduced by the Conservatives in the 1980s. As a result, they have harbored fierce resentment against upper class Tories from down south -- like Johnson.
But the Prime Minister, helped by his simple demands to honor the referendum to get the UK out of the European Union -- a goal many working class voters support and on which Labour has a muddled policy -- engineered a generational political shift.
Labour hotbeds have also been changing, a factor that seems to have escaped its ideologically radical left wing leaders in London. Some of those former industrialized areas have also started to regenerate. New industries are beginning to spring up in the place of mining and steel manufacturing that were driven out by globalization.
That has changed the demographics of some seats in Labour's red wall, and memories are fading of the great industrial strikes and battles against the Conservative governments of the 1980s.
Once, Labour was untouchable in the mill towns and mining villages of northern England and the shipyards of Scotland, piling up power through once-huge labor unions.
But it is seen increasingly as a socially liberal, metropolitan party that has moved on culturally from many of its more conservative working-class voters in the UK's rust belt. The power of unions is not what it was, and the urban liberal versus rural conservative divide is as important in UK politics as it is in America.
The Democratic Party has seemed to undergo a similar shift -- a factor seized upon by conservatives when Hillary Clinton blasted Trump's supporters as ""deplorables"" in 2016.
This has occurred as Trump has refashioned the GOP's country club image and worked to corral working-class voters disillusioned with conventional politics and economic policies that they believe left them behind.
It's ironic that it took a billionaire from Manhattan with his name splashed across his private jet and an Eton-educated toff to find a new political language to attract working class voters.
The themes of the political post-mortem among progressives in Britain after Johnson's rout will be familiar to anyone following the Democratic presidential race.
Moderate candidates like Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden are accusing their more radical rivals like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders of adopting a perilous Corbyn playbook.
The former vice president leaped on the comparison at a fundraiser on Thursday night as the UK results rolled in.
""Boris Johnson is winning in a walk,"" Biden said, predicting headlines reading, ""Look what happens when the Labour Party moves so, so far to the left. It comes up with ideas that are not able to be contained within a rational basis quickly.""
Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire centrist who launched a presidential campaign because he believes the Democrats are too extreme and can't beat Trump, also jumped on the UK bandwagon.
""Jeremy Corbyn's catastrophic showing in the U.K. is a clear warning: We need a Democratic nominee who can defeat Donald Trump by running a campaign that appeals to Americans across our divides,"" Bloomberg wrote on Twitter Friday.
The Democratic primary has seen pitched debates over issues like expanding the federal government's role in health care and free college, and squabbles about how ideologically pure the party should be.
A similar debate has been going on for years since Corbyn took over the Labour Party. He reversed former multiple-election-winning Prime Minister Tony Blair's modernization project.

here are often similarities between US and UK politics. After all, these are two great Western democracies that are prone to similar economic, cultural and demographic forces and issues.
Former President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher forged a linked conservative renaissance in both nations in the 1980s. Bill Clinton and Tony Blair bonded over Third Way centrism a decade later.
And on Thursday, Britons chose to stick with a blond-haired, thin-on-details, populist-style leader with a complicated relationship with the truth and open contempt for the press.
Trump certainly took inspiration for his own fortunes after Johnson secured the biggest Conservative majority since Thatcher's second reelection race in 1987.
""It might be a harbinger of what's to come in our country. It was last time,"" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday.
Britain's surprising referendum vote to leave the European Union in 2016 foreshadowed Trump's victory later that year and was based on some similar populist, anti-establishment trends -- though Trump's repeated claims that he predicted the result are a flight of fancy.
Still, Conservatives' win -- and the Democratic presidential race and omens for Trump's reelection -- are not a perfect comparison for the primary race of the 2020 US election.
Corbyn was a historically radical figure. He would have been the most left-wing Prime Minister in British history. His platform of huge public spending and nationalizing utilities and the railways is far more ambitious than any Sanders is planning, for instance. That's notwithstanding the Vermont senator's vow to forge a ""revolution"" and plans for single-payer health care. Trump's complaints that Sanders is a radical socialist might be more accurate if addressed to Corbyn.
And Corbyn's problems were not just political.
His personality and history of association with radical and extremist global political groups like the IRA and Hamas left many traditional Labour voters uneasy. Critics saw him, at best, in denial about a row over anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. And party activists reported that Corbyn was a problem constantly raised by voters during canvassing.
It's unlikely that whoever emerges as the Democratic nominee will advocate values quite so antithetical to millions of voters.
Britain's vote was also overlaid by complications over Brexit that make it difficult to draw direct lines with the US.
Corbyn had a muddled position on the issue that did not appeal to core Labour voters who wanted out. Johnson campaigned on a simple phrase -- ""Get Brexit Done"" -- that recalled the clarity of Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" mantra. His challenge in the next few years will be to lock in voters who supported him over Brexit who have a generational suspicion of the Conservative Party and might return to Labour if it returns to a more moderate path.
Trump is seeking to do exactly the same thing in his reelection race in 2020 in midwestern swing states. And the President has been careful not to replicate one of the Labour Party's mistakes: His entire presidency -- with its riotous rallies and careful appeals to the base on issues like abortion and gun control -- sometimes seems like an attempt to stress his cultural affinity with the people who put him in power.


But while Trump frequently praises Johnson and both are seen as populists of the same mold, the comparisons can be overdrawn.
Johnson and Trump do share deep suspicion of the European Union. And their populism and the revolt against the establishment does seem motivated by political expediency.
Trump, in his years as a flamboyant real estate magnate and tabloid target, was often snubbed by Manhattan's social and political elites. But Johnson is hardly an outsider. He was educated at the elite Eton private school and comes from a social class that still regards itself as born to rule. While Trump seems dedicated to tearing down the social and political order, Johnson, whose hero is Winston Churchill, is simply clambering back to his ordained place in its upper echelons.
And the British Prime Minister is -- Brexit apart -- an utterly conventional figure. He's less radical than Thatcher in his conservatism. And from his belief in climate change to his position on the Iran nuclear deal, he's far closer to European leaders than Trump.
He's vowing to pour billions of British pounds into the country's state-run national health service -- a position that puts him closer to Sanders and Warren than to Trump.
In fact, Johnson sits comfortably in an ideological spectrum that encompasses leaders like Blair, Clinton, Barack Obama and former Prime Minister David Cameron. He's far from the disruptive, tear-down-the-establishment instincts of Trump.
And Britain's Labour Party is generally to the left of the Democrats -- its radical wings are far closer to authentic socialism than Sanders' proposals. And the balance of power of the Conservative Party, which, while radicalized over Europe, is to the left of the GOP's ideology on social issues.
So while there are clear comparisons and lessons to be drawn from the UK election result as the US looks towards 2020, the most important one might be this: every country and every election is unique.

https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/26/politics/climate-change-poll-report/index.html,"The new government report on climate change, which the Trump administration released quietly a day after Thanksgiving and two days after President Donald Trump tweeted skeptically about the existence of climate change, warns that the drastic human effects on the climate could cause thousands of Americans to die and cost the US economy hundreds of billions of dollars.
But even before the report was made public, Americans were extremely worried about climate change.
Almost two-thirds (64%) of voters said the US needs to be doing more to address climate change, according to a poll by Quinnipiac University in August, up from 57% who said the same in December 2015.
This opinion is divided by party lines: 91% of Democrats said more should be done, and 67% of independents agreed. Fewer Republicans (one third) said more should be done about climate change, and another third of Republicans thought that the US is doing enough to address climate change. In the December 2015 Quinnipiac poll, 83% of Democrats thought the US should be doing more, compared to 62% of independents and 26% of Republicans.
The Trump administration chose to speed up release of the new report, which is required by law, putting it out on Black Friday instead of in December. It also came two days after Trump issued another tweet transmitting his skepticism of the existence of Climate change.
""Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming?"" he said Wednesday on Twitter.
An earlier portion of the climate change report was released in November 2017 and found ""no convincing alternative explanation"" for the changing climate other than ""human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases.""
A CBS news poll from April of this year found a majority of Americans (54%) thought climate change was caused by mostly human activity (such as burning fossil fuels) rather than the quarter who said it's caused by mostly natural patterns. The number who said it's impacted more by human activity is up from only 46% who said so in February 2014.
Trump has stood by his years-old claim that climate change is a hoax and emphasized that belief with his statements about the California wildfires, which he said were a result of poor forest management, drawing criticism from firefighters, climate scientists and many others.
The government report, which is called the National Climate Assessment, addressed wildfires, reporting that one impact of climate change will be longer and more destructive wildfires, that could burn up to six times more forest annually by 2050 in parts of the US.
California's wildfires are the worst in the state's history. Over half (53%) of voters in the August Quinnipiac poll said climate change is a factor in making fires more extreme. At that point, the fires in California were only beginning, and some are still burning in November, so it's unclear whether that number has changed since August. Eight-in-10 Democrats, 54% of independents, and 22% of Republicans thought in August that climate change has an impact the fires.
Another impact of climate change will be on the health of Americans, whether because of extreme heat and higher temperatures, diseases (like Zika) that come from mosquitoes and ticks, more food and waterborne diseases, or higher risk of asthma and allergies.
Concern about climate change and global warming has gone up in the last few years -- from 33% who said they worry a great deal about it in March 2013 to 43% who say the same now, according to Gallup.
Around the same number (45%) said they think global warming will pose a serious threat to them or their way of life in their lifetimes in the March poll. That's up from 2010, when Gallup first asked it and only a third of Americans thought global warming would impact them. Democrats are much more likely to think they'll be impacted (67%) than independents (45%) or Republicans (18%), but whether that's because more Democrats live in coastal regions or due to just plain partisanship, it's hard to tell.
In a statement by White House deputy press secretary Lindsey Walters, the Trump administration downplayed the report, saying it ""is largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that despite strong economic growth that would increase greenhouse gas emissions, there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population.""

https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/06/opinions/methodist-church-schism-lgbtq-rights-graves-fitzsimmons/index.html,"A diverse group of leaders in the United Methodist Church proposed a plan last Friday to split the church into two denominations. If the plan is approved by delegates to the church's general conference this May, the main body of the United Methodist Church would recognize the dignity of LGBTQ people, and a new ""traditionalist"" Methodist denomination would peel off to continue in a separate branch what they see as the ""tradition"" of exclusion, banning same sex marriage and LGBTQ people from the clergy.

his is not the first time American Methodists have split over the issue of human dignity. The predecessor to today's United Methodist Church split over the issue of slavery in 1844 and did not reunite until 1939.
The issue of ordaining and marrying LGBTQ people has been contentious within the denomination for decades. Now the United Methodist Church, the nation's second largest Protestant denomination, has reached another breaking point.
Like many, I've believed for the past several years that schism is necessary. I know the deep pain, yet also resolve, that brought the church to this breaking point. But if 2020 does indeed result in a schism of the Methodist movement like 1844, it's because a break is needed, if unity cannot be achieved, to ensure human dignity is respected.
The debate around recognizing the rights and dignity of LGBTQ people has been waged in the United Methodist Church since 1972 when the words ""The United Methodist Church does not condone the practice of homosexuality and considers this practice incompatible with Christian teaching"" were added to the denomination's Book of Discipline.
For the past 48 years, ""traditionalists"" have relied on a handful of Bible passages, not attributed to Jesus, that they believe condemn homosexuality and their belief that the church has always taught homosexuality is sinful. While citing ""tradition"" is a shaky argument, since the prohibition against homosexuality was only added in 1972, there is certainly a ""tradition"" of conservative Christianity. It's the tradition that continually denies the image of God in women, people of color and LGBTQ people.
Progressives argue that Jesus called his followers to constantly expand who was considered part of the circle of God's love. They point to Jesus' own words in the Gospels about loving your neighbor as yourself. In addition to the progressives and ""traditionalists,"" there have been millions of Methodists in the middle, neither condemning LGBTQ people nor advocating for their liberation.
The 48 years of debate have caused immeasurable suffering to those whose humanity has been denied by their church and increasing frustration among ""traditionalists,"" progressives and moderates. The ""traditionalists"" want to be free to take the Methodist movement in a hard-right return to ""orthodoxy."" The progressives want to be free to celebrate the gifts of LGBTQ in the church. And the moderates just want to be free of the debate altogether.
And then there is the effect on the human beings who have been affected by this controversy within the church. My reaction to the news of the plan to split has been deeply personal.


Faith could bring us together. But too often it divides us
In 1989, in the midst of the struggle for LGBTQ liberation, I was born into a Methodist family in Houston, Texas. I knew I was gay from a young age. I also knew I loved church. Church was the place where everyone was welcome without exception, where there wasn't a distinction between the ""cool"" and ""uncool"" kids, and where I was taught that God made me in God's own image.
Thanks be to God, I was raised in a Methodist congregation that never condemned LGBTQ people. The pastor that served my church when I was in high school actually celebrated us and preached about the harm of the denomination's anti-LGBTQ policies. So many LGBTQ people endure the trauma of being attacked as children in their churches and I'll always be grateful that I avoided that experience.
I was active in my Methodist college's campus ministry program and joined a wonderfully LGBTQ-inclusive church in Washington, D.C. after college. My experience with Methodist communities growing up was largely positive, but the ""tradition"" of condemnation by the denomination grew in my conscience as I started seminary in 2014.
While I took courses required for ordination in the United Methodist Church, I also met people from other Protestant denominations who could serve openly as LGBTQ people, without fear of institutional reproach or exclusion. One person I met was my future husband, who was the first openly LGBTQ person to be ordained as a minister in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) in Texas, where we both grew up.


I attended the Methodist general conference in Portland, Oregon in 2016 and reached my own personal breaking point. I committed myself to start the official ordination process immediately if the church recognized my dignity. I took a deep breath of hope for the church and my place in it, then let that hopeful breath leave my body for good when the denomination did not lift the ban on same-sex marriages and ordaining LGBTQ people.
I'm happy to report that I found a wonderful new church home at Highland Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky, where my husband and I now reside.
I still feel very connected to the people called Methodists. My family's roots in the church go back generations, and I still pray fervently for the day when all Methodists may follow their calling to serve the church.
I celebrate with any church that recognizes human dignity in all people, and this plan for schism would likely result in the majority of Methodist churches in the United States doing just that. Schism will be painful for some because it will force individual congregations to decide which denomination to affiliate with going forward. I mourn the many more ""votes"" that will take place on the local level that will feel to LGBTQ people and our families like a referendum on our God-given worth. My heart breaks for children raised in the ""traditionalist"" denomination, for this ""tradition"" comes with the consequences of young people suffering greatly as they are compelled to deny their identity, some, in the most extreme cases, committing suicide rather than coming out to their anti-LGBTQ families and churches.
Even as I cautiously welcome the schism as necessary, I pray for the day when all Christians of any denomination in the United States and around the world recognize the God-given dignity of LGBTQ people. Alongside the long tradition of exclusion that is evident today and throughout Christian history, there is also a tradition of progressive Christians taking bold action for human dignity and the common good. I know that tradition of boldness will continue no matter what our denomination configuration may be.

https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/08/politics/leonardo-dicaprio-trump-climate-change-meeting/index.html,"Leonardo DiCaprio met with President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday to discuss climate change -- adding to the mixed signals from the President-elect on the environment.

""We presented the President-elect and his advisors with a framework ... that details how to unleash a major economic revival across the United States that is centered on investments in sustainable infrastructure,"" Terry Tamminen, CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, said in a statement. ""Our conversation focused on how to create millions of secure, American jobs in the construction and operation of commercial and residential clean, renewable energy generation.
DiCaprio's meeting with Trump only added to the mixed messages coming out of Trump Tower, particularly on the issue of climate change.
On the same day of his meeting with DiCaprio, Trump tapped Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt -- a climate change denier -- to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt is an opponent of many of the Obama EPA's environmental regulations, and sued the agency over its regulations of power plants in his capacity as attorney general.
Coupled with Trump's own history of climate change skepticism, environmentalists see dim prospects for action that scientists say is necessary to avert the most devastating consequences of climate change. Trump has called climate change a ""hoax"" but in a recent interview allowed for the possibility that human activity may be contributing to global warming.
Trump held a separate meeting this week with another high-profile environmental activist -- former Vice President Al Gore, who has also championed the fight against climate change in his career after politics.
DiCaprio has used his celebrity to champion environmental causes. He emphasized the threat of climate change in his 2016 Academy Awards acceptance speech -- ""Climate change is real, it is happening right now,"" he said -- and produced a documentary on the subject, titled ""Before the Flood,"" which was released this year. According to ""The Independent,"" DiCaprio gave Ivanka Trump a copy of the documentary at the meeting.
The statement from his foundation added that ""climate change is bigger than politics, and the disastrous effects on our planet and our civilization will continue regardless of what party holds majorities in Congress or occupies the White House.""
And according to the foundation, there may be another meeting.
""The President-elect expressed his desire for a follow up meeting in January, and we look forward to continuing the conversation with the incoming administration as we work to stop the dangerous march of climate change, while putting millions of people to work at the same time,"" Tamminen said in the statement.
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the DiCaprio meeting.
How drastic might Trump's climate change policy changes be? A report released in November by the International Energy Agency (IEA) outlines two key scenarios for emissions and global warming in the coming decades.
The first scenario assumes world leaders keep the promises made in Paris last year at the United Nation's COP21 summit. The agreement between more than 175 countries introduced environmentally friendly policies to slow the increase in emissions and global warming.
The second scenario assumes no real action is taken and agreements are brushed aside, resulting in a 36% surge in carbon dioxide emissions by 2040, nearly three times the increase expected under the first scenario. While that would be a nightmare for environmentalists, it's unlikely that all Paris signatories would abandon their pledges.
Still, according to a recent United Nations Environment report, the world is still heading for a temperature rise of 2.9 to 3.4 degrees Celsius this century, even with the Paris pledges."
https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/politics/kamala-harris-climate-plan/index.html,"Sen. Kamala Harris is leaning in on her record as a California prosecutor who sought to punish polluters in her new $10 trillion climate plan, which aims for a carbon-neutral US economy by 2045.

The proposal, released to CNN ahead of the network's climate town hall Wednesday night, centers on widely shared Democratic beliefs of investing in zero-emission transportation and carbon-neutral electricity. Like other candidates, Harris pledges to reverse the Trump administration's rollbacks of federal environmental rules. But the California Democrat also leans on her record of punishing polluters as the state's attorney general and San Francisco's district attorney.
In a statement released with her plan, Harris says her presidential climate proposal is ""about putting people first, justice for communities that have been harmed and accountability for those responsible. It provides the pathway to engage all Americans to tackle the climate crisis, build a clean economy that creates millions of family-sustaining jobs, and guarantee every person's right to breathe clean air and drink clean water.""
The proposal includes ways to raise revenue, such as creating a pollution fee and eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, but the campaign did not further specify how it would be paid for.
The plan builds on a number of Harris' proposed Senate bills.
To reach the overall carbon-neutral goal by 2045, Harris would invest $10 trillion in public and private spending over 10 years to create millions of jobs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in electricity and ground transportation. Her plan pledges to create ""progressive year-on-year benchmarks that target individual sectors,"" such as energy, infrastructure and industry.
The major benchmark year highlighted in the plan is 2030, to reach the goal of 100% carbon-neutral electricity. Harris would reinstate federal emission rules for vehicles, leading to 50% of new passenger vehicles sold being zero-emission by 2030 and 100% of cars zero-emission by 2035. Low- and middle-income families would be boosted by an expansion of the electric vehicle tax credit and by improving a ""cash for clunkers"" program that incentivizes replacing gas-fueled cars with zero-emission vehicles.
Rural, farming and ranching communities would see the deployment of clean energy technology and the help of the US Department of Agriculture to ""fully implement science-based agricultural conservation practices by 2040,"" a part of the plan Harris calls ""climate-smart agriculture.""
Her proposal also allocates up to $8,000 each for unemployed, dislocated or underemployed workers for skills and education training to create jobs in the green economy.
As California's attorney general, Harris jointly prosecuted Plains All American Pipeline with the Santa Barbara County district attorney, which resulted in a grand jury indictment on 46 criminal charges related to the largest oil spill in Southern California in decades.
She also helped secure for California an $85 million settlement with Volkswagen for cheating on emissions tests for its diesel vehicles. If Harris is elected, her plan promises to follow that same prosecutorial path, increasing penalties for companies that violate federal pollution laws and restoring the ""polluter pays"" model for funding the Superfund program.
On pursuing polluters, Harris pledges she will end federal subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, including eliminating tax preferences and opposing new fossil fuel infrastructure projects. Harris says she will leverage both executive action and Congress to end that federal support.
Harris also leans into the Climate Equity Act, legislation that she and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Dermocrat, announced in Congress earlier this summer. The draft proposal focusesf on ""frontline communities,"" those that have experienced systemic socioeconomic disparities.
Like with her gun-safety proposal, Harris promises she would use her executive authority as president to swiftly implement principles in her Climate Equity Act, such as instituting an independent Office of Climate and Environmental Justice Accountability to represent the views of these front-line communities.
Harris also pledges to pursue her Water Justice Act, a $250 billion plan addressing the drinking water crisis in rural communities.
On the international scale, Harris, like many of her fellow 2020 hopefuls, says her administration would immediately rejoin the Paris climate accord.
""The entire world is looking for climate solutions,"" Harris says in the final paragraph of her 24-page proposal. ""Americans can and must lead."""
https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/01/politics/among-republican-gunowners-nra-hardline/index.html,"Disagreement over gun control and gun rights is among the most important and defining issues in the country today. They're so charged that about a quarter of voters will only vote for a candidate who shares their view on the subject, regardless of other factors of the candidate, no exceptions, according to Gallup.

NRA members, and this should come as no shock, are much more likely than other gun owners to say owning a gun is very important to their overall identity. Nearly half (45%) of NRA members said it's very important to their overall identity, while only 20% of non-NRA members said the same, according to a 2017 Pew poll.
""Republican and Republican-leaning gun owners are twice as likely as Democratic and Democratic-leaning gun owners to say they belong to the NRA (24% vs. 11%).
Divisions among these gun owners run deep as well.
It should be no surprise that as partisan politics seem to have pervaded our lives, membership in an advocacy group tells you something about someone's partisanship. But it shows that the meaning of gun ownership really has changed and that even among Republicans gun ownership means starkly different things.
Just a down-the-line policy comparison among Republicans who are NRA members and who are not according to Pew's 2017 poll draws a clear distinction.
Fifty-two percent of Republican gun owners who belong to the NRA say gun laws in the US should be less strict than they are now compared with 33% of Republican gun owners who don't belong to the NRA, according to Pew.
On specific policies, the gap is wider. Republican NRA members are 23% less likely to support universal background check policies like closing the gun show loophole than Republican gun owners who are not in the NRA. That's a wide rift within the party among people who are often grouped into one block.
Republican NRA members are also more activist in pushing gun rights policies than non-members. They're 16% more likely to support shortening waiting periods for buying guns illegally, for example.
There's evidence to support the idea that the NRA slowly evolved over many years to support a coalition that holds these views.
An exhaustive examination of past NRA editorials, membership communications and trainings found that over the last several decades, the organization put more emphasis on second amendment rights and the ways gun control policies posed a threat to gun owners' identity as law-abiding Americans or patriots. It's made gun rights as important and partisan an idea to its members as race or ethnicity can be to other portions of the population.
At the grassroots level, it's translated into political action. Forty-six percent of gun owners in the NRA say they have contacted a public official to express their opinion on gun policy compared with 15% of non-member gun owners who say they have ever done this.
As Congress looks for common ground on gun policy, there's no denying the importance of mobilized gun owners, particularly in local and state elections. But it's still a mistake to think they represent all gun owners, or even all Republicans who own guns."
https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/21/opinions/gun-control-opinion-costello/index.html,"Pump the brakes, progressives, and listen. Thanks to those activist kids from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the national conversation surrounding guns is evolving -- and it's evolving in a serious way. Some gun owners are already taking action.
If you are someone who is passionately fighting for gun control on social media or with your feet, keep it up. I'm not suggesting you take yourselves out of your activist role, I'm saying maybe, just maybe, it's time to listen, too. Really listen.


As conservative talker and former Trump campaign manager, John Fredericks told me, ""We cannot have the debate in the (Michael) Bloomberg fashion."" In other words, conservatives don't want to preached to by liberals or independents on gun control.
Instead, he says the onus is on gun owners -- like himself -- to have a legitimate conversation about what can be done to curtail gun violence.
Fredericks is not the only gun owner who believes it's time. Rick Peters, who owns a group of radio stations in Montgomery, Alabama, is all in.
""We are at a tipping point,"" he told me. ""The argument seems to be that we need these assault weapons to protect ourselves -- which is frankly, nonsense.""
Peters owns an AR-15 and plans to get rid of the weapon. ""This is a silly discussion,"" he says. ""Nobody needs an assault weapon.""
He also owns a shotgun and a handgun and is now in favor of an assault-weapon ban.
""This is not about a gun grab, this is not about not supporting the Second Amendment,"" he says. ""This is about what kind of gun do you have [a] right to own.""


Other gun owners disagree with Peters on that, but they, too, are willing to talk about gun control. Jason Cazes owns a gun store in Seattle, Washington. ""I don't think either side trusts each other,"" Cazes told me. ""All we have heard is there's going to be a common-sense solution, but all that leads to is, 'We want to take away your ARs and high-cap mags.'""
That doesn't mean Cazes is opposed to common-sense solutions. In fact, he's not waiting for the left or the right to have a come-to-Jesus moment. He is taking matters into his own hands and changing the rules when it comes to buying guns in his store.
""I changed policy yesterday,"" he said. ""To buy a long gun, including an AR, you have to be 21 years old, unless... you're active duty or honorably discharged military. You would be exempted because you have been through boot camp and know how to be a man and use this gun.""
I have talked with other gun owners, even members of the National Rifle Association, who also want change. But the preaching, on both sides of the gun issue, must stop.
I trust that every American cares about our children. As Fredericks told me, ""I am a father of three, I am a pro-Second Amendment. I was chairman of the Trump campaign in Virginia. But you know ... those who believe in the sanctity of the Second Amendment have to be able to have a legitimate conversation about this issue.""
Many gun-rights advocates are having that conversation. So, gun-control activists, keep protesting -- keep pushing for change -- but don't forget to stop every now and again to listen. Because the conversation is, at the very least, progressing -- on both sides.
"
https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/22/technology/youtube-gun-videos/index.html,"The video platform published new guidelines on Monday that ban videos showing how to assemble a firearm or install certain accessories such as high-capacity magazines.

The new regulations, first reported by Bloomberg, come as the Google-owned platform has come under criticism for lax policies regarding what content users can post.

""We routinely make updates and adjustments to our enforcement guidelines across all of our policies. While we've long prohibited the sale of firearms, we recently notified creators of updates we will be making around content promoting the sale or manufacture of firearms and their accessories, specifically, items like ammunition, gatling triggers, and drop-in auto sears,"" a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement.

The spokesperson said YouTube will begin enforcing the new guidelines in April. The company said it is not banning gun demonstration videos.

Among the new rules: No videos that intend to sell a firearm or certain accessories that turn a firearm into an automatic weapon are allowed. No videos that provide instructions on making or installing a gun, ammunition, high-capacity magazine, homemade silencer or other certain accessories will be allowed. Neither will videos showing how to convert a firearm into an automatic weapon.

For years, YouTube has banned firearm sales on its platform. The platform has been gradually increasing restrictions on certain gun videos. A few days after the October mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert, YouTube banned instructional videos that showed how to install and use a bump stock, which increases the number of bullets a rifle can fire."
https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/13/opinions/gun-sale-spike-after-parkland-levine-mcknight/index.html,"With Thursday's one-year anniversary of the Parkland shooting that gripped America's attention, Democrats are reintroducing a bill to ban high-capacity gun magazines. If history is any guide and this bill garners substantive support, the debate over that measure -- like the discussions after shootings at Parkland, Sandy Hook and San Bernardino -- could increase gun sales.


What distinguishes these three shootings from the others is the prolonged national media attention and changes in public opinion that occurred regarding gun control. In the past, we have argued that the national attention that drove the prior surges in gun sales resulted from specific national policy proposals, including background checks on all gun sales and assault weapons bans. What we learn from Parkland is that a grassroots movement successful in generating national attention also leads to such a spike, even in the absence of significant policy actions.
According to our analysis, 600,000 additional guns were sold between February and April 2018 -- beyond the 6.7 million that would have been expected otherwise over that period. Sandy Hook and San Bernardino generated an additional 3 million and 1.7 million additional guns, respectively, sold in the few months after those shootings.
Fear of gun control is a powerful determinant of gun sales; that fear is stoked when a mass shooting receives tremendous national attention. Mass shootings tend to receive that attention, but it typically lasts for just a few days. President Barack Obama extended the focus after Sandy Hook and San Bernardino by proposing specific new national gun control regulations.
Parkland was different. After briefly indicating support to ""get something done"" after the Parkland shooting, President Donald Trump reiterated his strong support for gun rights. With Republicans controlling both houses of Congress at the time, there was no reason to expect any substantive national gun control legislation. 
If the prospect of meaningful national gun control legislation is the factor driving spikes in gun sales, we should not have seen one after Parkland. So, why did one occur?


One potential explanation is that a new focus on state gun control legislation drove the increase in gun sales. Indeed, Parkland did generate many new laws at the state level, which may have contributed to greater concern about restrictions on gun access. In total, 25 states enacted new gun control laws in the six months after the shooting. Six states (Florida, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin) did so in March of 2018, within weeks of the shooting.
Yet our analysis shows that these state laws did not drive the spike in gun sales. One may have expected the six states quickly implementing new laws to experience larger spikes in gun sales relative to the rest of the country, but they did not. For instance, the percentage change in gun sales between March 2017 and March 2018 in Florida, where legislation was enacted, was no larger than neighboring Georgia with no law change, or even compared to the national average.
These laws may have had little impact on gun sales, precisely because they were not intended to have a broad impact. The types of laws passed are highly targeted at reducing gun access among very specific types of potential offenses (domestic violence) or offenders (the mentally ill). It is unknown whether these laws have the precision necessary to get the job done, but they largely do not affect gun availability for the broader public.
A more plausible explanation, suggested by Parkland, is that public attention may remain on gun control over a prolonged period, even if there is no substantive national gun control legislation pending. After Sandy Hook and San Bernardino, the formal gun control debates started by Obama accomplished that. After Parkland, students, such as Emma Gonzalez and David Hogg, were successful in keeping the story in the news for an extended period. The March for Our Lives on March 24, about six weeks after the Parkland shooting, helped as well. Past analyses document the lengthier media coverage devoted to Parkland compared to other infamous mass shootings.
That national attention may have generated fear among gun rights advocates despite the lack of national legislative interest. That fear may not have matched the level after Sandy Hook and San Bernardino, which did generate national legislative interest, but it did occur. Indeed, national polls after Parkland showed rising popular support for stricter gun laws. And our analysis shows that the states where gun sales rose the most after Parkland are the states where Obama received the lowest electoral support in 2012. These states have the highest gun sales and represent the locations where fear would most likely translate to greater gun purchases.
Spikes in gun sales can have dangerous consequences. Our past research shows that the large influx of newly purchased weapons leads to more accidental deaths. Those guns are more likely to be stored improperly and handled by their new owners, potentially resulting in accidental discharge. We found that around 60 people were killed this way in the few months after Sandy Hook.
What can we learn from all this -- if our goal is to reduce gun-related injuries? Any substantive, national discussion of gun control is likely to increase gun sales, at least in the short run. The more serious the discussion, the greater the increase in sales. And the greater the increase in sales, the more accidental deaths may result.
This conclusion should not be misconstrued as suggesting policymakers avoid proposing restrictions on guns. Rather, policymakers should seek to minimize the short-term consequences associated with such proposals. The most effective gun control discussions are those that translate into bold policy proposals that are enacted rapidly.
A proposal to ban assault weapons, for instance, would be more effective if it is enacted quickly, rather than after lengthy debate, to minimize the unintended consequences from spikes in sales. Of course, with Republicans in control of the White House and the Senate, the current proposal to ban high-capacity gun magazines is unlikely to receive the necessary political support to turn policy into law.

https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/07/opinions/virginia-election-gun-safety-watts/index.html,"On Tuesday night, after years of making incremental gains, Virginians finally elected a gun sense majority in both houses of the General Assembly.
Voters went to the polls and held their lawmakers accountable for failing to address the gun violence crisis that has traumatized community after community in the Commonwealth. And polling throughout the election showed that gun safety was the defining election issue that energized voters.

Virginia already has a governor who is ready and waiting for the new General Assembly to pass good gun bills that he can sign into law.
And these stronger gun laws could save an untold number of lives, in the Commonwealth and beyond. Loopholes in Virginia's laws have made it a major feeder of crime guns into the country's ""Iron Pipeline,"" the route used to traffic firearms up and down the I-95 corridor. Between 2013 and 2017, nearly 16,000 crime guns that originated in Virginia were recovered in crimes in states outside of Virginia -- and more than 12,000 of these crime guns were traced in states that have comprehensive background check laws.
Research shows that just by closing the loophole in Virginia's laws that allow unlicensed gun sales without a background check, gun trafficking could be reduced by 48% in cities and by 29% across state lines.
For years however, Virginia Republicans largely refused to take action against gun violence, even though the vast majority of their constituents support stronger gun laws. And after the mass shooting in May at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center that killed 12 people and wounded four others, the Republican-led legislature sat on its hands. The governor called a special session specifically to address Virginia's gun violence crisis, but Republicans blocked any vote on gun safety and ended the session after just 90 minutes.
Republicans' abject failure to act outraged our volunteers. It became our mission to ensure this election was a referendum on gun violence.
According to a Washington Post-Schar School poll, gun safety was the single top issue for Virginia voters, ahead of even bread-and-butter topics like education, health care and the economy.
When I canvassed in cities across the state in October and again in early November, I heard over and over again that Virginians — regardless of their political affiliations — wanted to send a strong signal to both state and federal lawmakers: ""Do the right thing and we'll have your back; do the wrong thing and we'll have your job.""


And we backed up that demand with dollars and grassroots force. Everytown for Gun Safety spent $2.5 million on ads, direct mail, polling and contributions to gun sense candidates and political committees. Moms Demand Action volunteers made more than 100,000 calls, knocked on tens of thousands of doors, sent hundreds of thousands of texts and recruited volunteers across the country to call Virginia voters, too.
A retired volunteer couple in Fairfax spent the last few months going back and forth to Richmond to canvass in competitive legislative districts near the capital. Another volunteer from Loudoun attended numerous candidate forums to keep gun safety front and center for candidates, and tabled at farmers markets to encourage her community to vote.
And over in Montgomery County, Maryland, a volunteer helped organize nearly 20 events for out-of-state volunteers to contact Virginia voters and let them know the stakes of this election. She showed up to Virginia to knock on doors in the pouring rain and phone banked during the World Series.
And volunteers far away from Virginia — in places like Ohio, Nevada and Oregon — hosted phone banks, texted and wrote postcards to encourage Virginians to vote because they know guns travel across state lines as easily as cars do, and electing candidates who support stronger gun laws will make all Americans safer.
And that's one more reason this win in the Virginia legislature was monumental: It serves as a warning to lawmakers running in 2020 who still side with the gun lobby — particularly US Senators who have gun safety bills on their desks but haven't acted — that their jobs are in jeopardy.
It also sends a strong signal to the more than 90% of Americans who support universal background checks that we can go toe-to-toe with the gun lobby and win, and we will fight like hell to do it again next year.
In 2019, we showed Virginia lawmakers what happens when they don't stand up for our families. And after this win, you can bet that in 2020 we'll be doubling down.

https://money.cnn.com/2017/10/02/investing/las-vegas-shooting-gun-stocks-sturm-ruger-american-outdoor-brands/index.html,"Shares of Sturm Ruger (RGR) were up 4%, while American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), the company formerly known as Smith & Wesson, gained more than 3%. A company named Olin (OLN), which owns the Winchester brand of ammunition, rose 6% to an all-time high.
The stocks have tended to rally in the immediate aftermath of mass killings, which sadly have become more routine.
The Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June 2016. San Bernardino in December 2015. The Aurora, Colorado movie theater and Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. in 2012.
Investors had bet that these massacres would lead to tougher gun control laws, especially because of tough talk from President Obama.
The stricter laws never materialized. Instead, gun sales climbed during the Obama administration's two terms as gun aficionados bought more firearms just in case rules changed at a national level or in individual states controlled by Democrats.
But shares of Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands have both fallen sharply since Donald Trump, who was endorsed by the National Rifle Association, was elected president.
Investors had feared that a win by his opponent, Hillary Clinton, last year would have led to stricter regulations.
Trump's win removed those fears, and gun company sales and profits have plunged as a result. FBI background checks for firearms have fallen as well.
Sturm Ruger said in August that its latest quarterly revenues were down 22% from a year ago and that earnings plummeted more than 50%.
The company said that the main reason for the sales drop was ""due to stronger-than-normal demand during most of 2016, likely bolstered by the political campaigns for the November 2016 elections.""
American Outdoor Brands reported a nearly 40% decrease in sales during its latest quarter last month.
The weak gun sales are having an impact on the sporting goods industry as well.
Sales have plunged at Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), and so has its stock. Shares are down 50% this year but the stock rose more than 1% Monday.
Gun sales have also dropped at Cabela's, which was recently acquired by Bass Pro Shops. And Gander Mountain shut several stores this year after filing for bankruptcy.
Shares of Las Vegas-based casinos and hotels, including Mandalay Bay owner MGM Resorts (MGM), also fell Monday.

https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/15/politics/marco-rubio-senate-floor-florida-shooting/index.html,"Sen. Marco Rubio said Thursday that gun restrictions would not have prevented the mass shooting at a high school in his home state.
""I understand. I really do. You read in the newspaper that they used a certain kind of gun and therefore let's make it harder to get those kinds of guns. I don't have some sort of de facto religious objection to that or some ideological commitment to that, per se,"" the Florida Republican said.
""If we do something, it should be something that works. And the struggle up to this point has been that most of the proposals that have been offered would not have prevented, not just yesterday's tragedy, but any of those in recent history,"" Rubio added. ""Just because these proposals would not have prevented these does not mean that we therefore raise our hands and say, 'Therefore, there's nothing we can do.'""


Rubio said that alongside guns, lawmakers should also ""focus on the violence part"" of policymaking.
The Florida senator had received $3.3 million from the National Rifle Association as of October 2017, according to The New York Times. Following the Pulse nightclub shooting, Rubio made similar comments, telling the BBC that tougher gun regulations would not have prevented the attack.
Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson countered Rubio's assertion that stricter gun laws could not have prevented Wednesday's shooting.
""We don't know that. Where in all of these mass shootings, you enumerated some, that go back to Columbine, where in all of these mass shootings if an assault rifle were not legal and therefore you could not purchase it, would not one of those rifles have been able to be used in the massacre?"" Nelson said. ""I was raised on a ranch. I've had guns all my life. I've hunted all my life. I still hunt with my son. You don't need an AR-15 for hunting.""

https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/01/opinions/anti-semitism-black-jewish-people-love/index.html,"For years, cabin greetings such as ""Good morning ladies and gentlemen"" have been as much part of the flying experience as safety demonstrations and seat belt buckling instructions.
But now, one European airline has advised its crew to make announcements more inclusive after a passenger complained.
EasyJet, a low-cost carrier and one of Europe's largest airlines, has issued its staff with guidance on welcoming passengers to their aircraft.
""We want our crew to be welcoming to everyone on board, so have provided some guidance to them on how best to do that in a way that is inclusive for everyone,"" a spokesperson for the airline told CNN Travel, emphasizing that it has not banned the greeting.
The move came after Andi Fugard, a senior lecturer at Birkbeck, University of London, complained to EasyJet in August. The airline told CNN travel its new guidance was not in reaction to the tweet.


Dear @easyJet, are you in some kind of competition to see how many times you can reinforce gender binaries? “Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls”, perfume strictly segrated again by “ladies and gentlemen”. Ditch sir/madam too. An organisation as huge as yours must do better.

""Are you in some kind of competition to see how many times you can reinforce gender binaries?"" tweeted @InductiveStep, an account which links to Fugard's personal website. CNN's efforts to reach Fugard for further comment were unsuccessful over the holiday break.
""'Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,' perfume strictly segregated again by 'ladies and gentlemen.' Ditch sir/madam too. An organisation as huge as yours must do better.""
EasyJet replied at the time that they were ""committed"" to focusing on diversity and inclusion, and would pass on the feedback.
The move comes four months after the original complaint, and two months since Air Canada announced it would be dropping ""ladies and gentlemen"" in favor of gender-neutral greetings.
A spokesperson from Stonewall, a UK-based LGBT campaign group, told CNN: ""Addressing a group of people with gender-neutral language is a really simple and positive way to make sure everyone feels welcome and included."
https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/19/sport/lgbt-premier-league-social-intl-spt/index.html,"When the Premier League kicked off its 'Rainbow Laces' campaign to support LGBT people this month, English football's highest division probably didn't expect to be flooded with abusive comments and feedback. But that's what happened.
Right across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, negative comments and reactions, which were described in one post as ""vile,"" inundated social media feeds.
One tweet said, ""God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!"" While another widely liked Facebook comment read, ""Take politics away from this beautiful sport.""
Other comments aimed at clubs supporting the campaign read, ""Crystal PalGay,"" ""SouthGay FC,"" and ""Why are they [Premier League clubs] forcing us to be homosexuals??""
Whereas in a number of sports and countries, gay athletes have been happy to be open about their sexuality, that hasn't been the case in English football. At the time of writing, in the Premier League there's not a single gay player, who has made his sexual orientation public.
And when you look at social media, can you blame them, asked Robbie de Santos, who is Director of Sport of Stonewall, which is Britain's leading LGBT charity.
""In male sport there is a real absence of openly gay or bi men -- we have to create a better environment that is truly LGBT inclusive at all levels,"" he told CNN Sport.
This month the Premier League and Stonewall, have collaborated on the 'Rainbow Laces' project — to try and stomp out homophobia in the game.
'Rainbow Laces' goes far beyond Premier League football, but there is no denying that top-tier English football opens the campaign up to a global audience. The project was inaugurated in 2013.
A large publicity campaign has been in full swing and the rainbow symbol — synonymous with the LGBT movement — has become ubiquitous across English football's highest division.
It has cropped up on LED boards, armbands on captains of teams, corner flags and even the laces of footballers over the course of two match weeks.
In an attempt to provide a snapshot into how the campaign was received across social media, CNN Sport took a look at Premier League clubs, who rebranded logos in LGBT colors on their Facebook profile pages.
In no way is this an exhaustive demonstration into how 'Rainbow Laces' was treated on social media but arguably it gives some insight into how fans and football followers reacted to soccer endorsement of LGBT rights.
CNN Sport focused on gauging the number of likes and angry reactions -- because they were the reactions most frequently used by Facebook users.
It is important to outline that reactions on Facebook, labeled in our graphic as ""other reactions,"" include love hearts, laughing faces, crying faces and shocked faces. Many of the posts we monitored did also receive a high number of these reactions too.
Offended by the rainbow flag? 'Get a life.'
Both the Premier League and the various clubs that comprise it have worked hard to plug the campaign effectively. And while 'Rainbow Laces' seems to have been warmly welcomed by a vast majority of people, social media paints a more complex picture.
In a world of reactions, likes, emojis and hashtags, things can get messy pretty quickly. Just how telling is an angry face emoji?
Well, put it this way, there is no option to dislike something on Facebook, but if you were aiming to show your dissatisfaction with something, the angry face is probably the route to go down.
Our analysis found that as many as 35,000 profiles reacted angrily to the wider Premier League's rainbow-themed logo change on Facebook.

And on a club level, when Aston Villa showed support for the campaign by also re-branding its logo on Facebook, more than half of the reactions were negative. That's almost 60% of the accounts that engaged with the post.
When Arsenal and Manchester United did the same thing, more than 50,000 accounts also reacted negatively — again with angry faces.
A club with a smaller fan base, Burnley, also had close to 50% negative reactions.
In fact, across the 19 Premier League clubs who rebranded its logos in solidarity with the LGBT campaign, there have been more than 200,000 negative reactions on Facebook.
One caveat: A few of the rebrands are from previous campaigns and are slightly older, but many are from this month's 'Rainbow Laces' initiative and provide insight into how LGBT issues are received online.
Despite promoting and supporting the campaign across social media, Sheffield United were the only top flight team not to rebrand their logo on Facebook.
Of all the clubs CNN monitored, many had a sizable proportion of negative reactions but both Aston Villa and Burnley had the most.
Burnley confirmed to CNN Sport that around 1,000 people were banned and blocked from Facebook during the promotion of the Rainbow Laces campaign.
""We received an unprecedented number of negative engagements during the campaign -- far exceeding anything the club has previously received on its Facebook account,"" the club's Media Manager, Darren Bentley said.
""It appears this was a targeted response from international followers, which isn't something we have encountered in the past.
""In total, we believe only around 5% of all the negative comments came from users who had actually 'liked' our official page, and could reasonably, therefore, be considered as followers of the club in some capacity.
""Any extreme instances of abuse were reported to Facebook. This was in the region of 50 comments. Even though we have experienced negative reactions, we have also had a lot of positive comments, addressing any issues raised in an intellectual and thoughtful manner,"" Bentley said.


While the 'Rainbow Laces' campaign was going on there were two incidents of homophobia at Premier League grounds in December.
Everton is currently investigating claims of alleged homophobic chanting in its home win against Chelsea, while Brighton threw out two visiting Wolves fans for homophobic abuse.
Paul Camillin, Brighton and Hove Albion's Head of Media and Communications, condemned any form of homophobic abuse and called it ""ridiculous"" that someone should be ostracized from the game simply because of their sexuality.
""If you're offended by a rainbow flag, you need to get a life,"" he told CNN Sport.
Historically, homophobic chants were very common a Brighton's away games, according to Camillin. He acknowledged that while things had improved, there was still a long way to go and said there were still ""massive overtones"" of homophobia on social media.
So, this all goes much further than emojis. And abusive comments, posts and tweets have been littered across social media.
Stonewall said its 'Rainbow Laces' campaign was all about making sport ""everyone's game."" De Santos said the abusive comments and reactions were ""really upsetting to see.""
""It's a reflection of the issues in society more generally and not just football,"" he said. ""When you see that level of hatred, it just reminds you why we do this -- I don't think it truly impacts the individual clubs but instead reaffirms why this is really important work,"" de Santos told CNN Sport.

Leicester City's goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel wears a rainbow themed captain's armband.
'Rainbow laces is for life not just for Christmas'
The Premier League is adamant that it wants LGBT inclusion and to make sure football is a sport for everyone. What they perhaps didn't anticipate was the global role they would have in fighting for it — including on social media.
""We respond quickly to any discriminatory responses on our social media posts and have our social media team have been monitoring comments -- they remove, report or hide offensive posts,"" the Premier League told CNN.
""We also work closely with social media platforms and have met with Twitter and Facebook to discuss and understand how we can work together to tackle unacceptable behavior taking place online.""
While it acknowledged the detractors, the Premier League were keen to emphasize that the campaign has largely been met positively, describing it as having ""fantastic support.""
It's an opinion that is shared by Stonewall's Robbie de Santos.
""For every step towards equality, you do have detractors ... we do generally see a much more positive response compared with the negativity,"" de Santos said.
""We have also seen significant shifts in public attitude as a result of the campaign,"" he added.

Everything from corner flags, advertising boards and shoe laces had a rainbow theme.
Paul Camillin said the response across Brighton's social media channels was largely positive and felt there had been a ""sea change"" this year when it came to LGBT rights.
""Perhaps society is growing up. It was really encouraging to see the response we got on social media. The entire campaign felt like it had momentum behind it and wasn't simply box ticking.
""If there was abuse we would always report it to the social media companies. We would block individuals and if we could then go on to identify the people responsible, we would ban them. We don't take it lightly. When we say zero tolerance, we mean zero tolerance.""
The overwhelming response across social media seems to be positive.
For example, of all the clubs CNN Sport monitored who re-branded on Facebook in support of 'Rainbow Laces,' only Aston Villa had more negative reactions than positive.
Around 75% of reactions to Chelsea's rainbow-themed logo were likes, while Tottenham Hotspur had around four times as many likes as angry emojis to their rebranded crest.
Someone who is all-to-aware of Spurs' effort to support LGBT interests is Proud Lilywhites co-chair, Chris Paouros.
Paouros said members of the LGBTQ+ supporters association linked to Tottenham had been directly upset by the abuse during the campaign and encouraged victims not to engage with ""online trolls.""
""The internet is often a safe space for abusers. People often wouldn't say these things if they were with you in person ... don't feed the trolls,"" she said.
""They might not even be a real person. What's important is people are encouraged to report anything — that's how we build up a body of evidence against someone.""
Paouros' appointment as trustee to anti-discrimination organization Kick It Out has allowed her to witness the work being done with social media companies to try and overcome hate, and she indicated more collaboration was going ahead.
And while Twitter didn't immediately respond to CNN for comment, Facebook Company spokesperson was keen to stress it was working hard to stop abuse on the platform and also Instagram.
""We want our platforms to be a safe and welcoming space for everyone and we do not allow hate speech of any kind,"" Facebook told CNN Sport.
""We continue to work with organizations across football on this issue and we encourage our community to continue to report anything that concerns them using our tools,"" a Facebook spokesperson told CNN Sport.
Although Paouros commended the Rainbow Laces campaign, she said it should ""exist in an ecosystem of good work' in football for the LGBT community.
""We are going to continue to work towards an environment that says you're welcome here. Football offers that feeling of collective hope, joy and euphoria, I don't want to deny that to anybody,"" she said.
""Rainbow laces is for life not just for Christmas — it's one thing doing something this week but diversity and inclusion needs to be embedded right into football.""
Brighton's Paul Camillin said the impact campaign's such as ""Rainbow Laces"" can have is huge.
""It's about educating youngsters. No one is born with a prejudice against a gay man or woman, it comes from the environment they grow up in,"" he said. Camillin also suggested the campaign could be having more of a global role than we realize.
Simply, the sight of a rainbow flag during a football game could change ""someone's life"" and do a lot for an individual in a country which is less welcoming to LGBT people, he said.
Stonewall's de Santos told CNN Sport that 'Rainbow Laces was ""here to stay"" and was becoming a key part of the sporting calendar.
""The campaign uses sport as a tool to connect with people. We know sport is loved and vital to communities, we want LGBT people to feel just as part of that community -- to feel safe, respected and welcome for who they are,"" he said.

https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/us/preferred-gender-pronouns-explainer-trnd/index.html,"If you feel like you've been hearing about pronouns a lot lately, you're on to something.
Sam Smith took to Instagram in September to announce that their pronouns are they/them. Merriam-Webster announced a few days later that ""they"" can also be used to refer to a single person whose gender identity is non-binary, meaning neither male or female. And recently, Sen. Kamala Harris introduced herself at a CNN LGBTQ Town Hall by stating that her pronouns are ""she, her and hers.""

Maybe all this is new to you. Maybe you're a little confused. Maybe you've been doing this for a while, but you know a friend, coworker or family member who could use some help. Whatever the case, we've got you covered.
CNN talked to Shige Sakurai, the founder of International Pronouns Day and the associate director of the LGBT Equity Center at the University of Maryland, College Park, about why it matters what pronouns you use to refer to people and what to do if you slip up.
What do we mean by pronouns exactly?
Time for a quick grammar refresher.
Personal pronouns are the words used in place of specific people, places or things. Pronouns like ""me, myself and I"" are how people talk about themselves, and pronouns like ""you, she, he and they"" are some pronouns that people use to talk about others.
A person's pronouns are the third-person singular pronouns that they would like others to use for them. Personal pronouns are used to convey a person's gender identity and don't necessarily align with the sex a person was assigned at birth.
The most common third-person singular pronouns are ""she/her/hers"" and ""he/him/his."" ""They/them"" can also be used to refer to a single person, while some people use gender-neutral or gender-inclusive pronouns like ""ze/hir"" (pronounced zee/here) instead. Some people might not use pronouns at all and go only by a name.
Why does it matter what pronouns you use to refer to someone?
Using the pronouns that a person goes by is a way of respecting that person's gender identity -- or a person's emotional and psychological sense of their own gender.
If someone tells you that they go by the pronouns ""they/them,"" for example, and you continue to refer to them using ""he/him/his"" pronouns, it can imply that you believe that transgender, non-binary or intersex people are unimportant, or shouldn't exist.

Intentionally calling someone by the wrong pronoun can make them feel disrespected or alienated, and can take a toll on their mental health. It is also offensive and can be considered harassment.
Sometimes people can use the wrong pronoun for others without realizing it or meaning any harm. People who aren't used to thinking about what pronouns others use to refer to themselves might make assumptions about someone else's pronouns based on their name or appearance.
But those assumptions can be incorrect and similarly hurtful because they imply a person has to look a certain way to demonstrate their gender identity.
Isn't using 'they/them' to refer to one person grammatically incorrect?
You might have learned in English class that ""they"" and ""them"" describe a group of people, while ""he"" and ""she"" describe a single person.
But language is constantly evolving, and you need look no further than the foremost authorities on language: dictionaries.

Merriam-Webster recently added a new definition in its entry for ""they,"" noting that the pronoun is also used to refer to an individual whose gender identity is non-binary.
Using ""they"" to refer to one person isn't just a new thing or a case of political correctness. Sakurai, who uses ""they/them"" pronouns, says they have been in spaces where this has been a practice for decades.
""It might be something that people are now becoming more aware of in more mainstream, broader spaces, but it's not something that's a new conversation for trans people or even for some people in the LGBT community sometimes,"" Sakurai said.
In fact, people have been using ""they"" as a singular pronoun as far back as the 14th century.
The Oxford English Dictionary traces singular ""they"" all the way back to 1375 where it appeared in a medieval romance, writes Dennis Baron, a professor of English and linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It's likely that singular ""they"" was used even earlier, given that words often exist in speech before they are written down.
Baron also notes that ""you"" was originally a plural pronoun, with its singular being ""thou, thee and thy."" Now we've happily accepted ""you"" as a pronoun to refer to a single person.
I want to be respectful, but I'm not sure where to start
Often, someone will outright tell you what pronouns they'd like for you to call them. If so, respect that.
If a person hasn't shared their pronouns and there's any doubt as to what they are, don't just guess. Instead, Sakurai suggests continuing to refer to that person by their name until you get more clarity.

Sakurai also recommends sharing your own pronouns first, which creates an invitation for others to do the same.
Asking a person directly about their pronouns is also an option, but be mindful of the context and environment that you're in. Is it in front of a large group of people where that person could feel singled out? Is the setting friendly to transgender and non-binary people? If you think the question could make someone feel singled out, it might be worth having a more private conversation.
Some people might not be ""out"" as transgender or non-binary in certain settings and might therefore be reluctant to share. Others might be transitioning or coming to terms with their gender identity and the question could bring up painful feelings for them. Use your best judgment.
Talking about pronouns feels awkward
Sure, it might feel a little uncomfortable at first, especially if you're not used to thinking about gender identity as distinct from a person's biological sex.
Ultimately though, normalizing the practice of sharing or asking about pronouns helps build a more supportive and inclusive environment for intersex, transgender and non-binary people. It lets those folks know that you see them and respect who they are.

Some easy ways to start doing this include incorporating your pronouns in your email signature or adding them to your bio on social media profiles.
And at the end of the day, sharing your own pronouns or asking for someone else's is not nearly as awkward as making an incorrect assumption.
What should I do if I slip up?
If you realize in the moment that you've mistakenly referred to someone using the wrong pronoun, the best thing to do is quickly correct yourself and move on. You can say something like, ""Sorry, I meant they.""
If you realize that you've made a mistake after a conversation has ended, apologize privately and move on.
Don't apologize over and over again or keep telling that person how badly you feel about your mistake, Sakurai says. Doing so can make the person who was misgendered feel uncomfortable or responsible for comforting you, which isn't their job.
If the person who you misgendered gets upset, try to put yourself in their shoes. Aside from feeling like their identity has been denied, it's possible that this person has experienced many similar instances and this one mistake finally pushed them to a breaking point, Sakurai says.
Keep in mind that their reaction might not necessarily be about you, but about the harm they've experienced by repeatedly being referred to incorrectly.

https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/11/opinions/town-hall-trans-women-protest-opinion-granderson/index.html,"The inaugural presidential town hall focused solely on LGBT equality featured a lot of memorable moments.
Senator Cory Booker, the night's first speaker, was politely laughed at for not answering a yes or no question about whether religious educational institutions that oppose LGBTQ rights should lose their tax-exempt status. Senator Elizabeth Warren had the zinger of the night when asked how she'd respond to an ""old-fashioned"" supporter who told her they believe marriage is between a man and a woman. Warren quipped: ""Then just marry one woman. I'm cool with that...assuming you can find one.""

And then there was former Vice President Joe Biden who suggested the vast majority of Americans are not homophobic but instead are afraid and don't know what to do or say. He finished his time mumbling something about bathhouses. It was as awkward as it sounds.
But the night did not belong to a single candidate but rather a single topic.
Several transgender women of color held small protests inside the town hall sporadically throughout the night in hopes of drawing attention to the string of underreported murders of similar women. According to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), which co-sponsored the event with CNN, more than 26 transgender people were murdered in 2018, most of whom were black transgender women.
So far this year HRC has reported that 19 transgender women have been killed. The lack of media coverage of these deaths is particularly jarring when juxtaposed against the frequent reminders that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots.
Those protests, in response to police persecution 50 years ago, are seen as the birth of the modern gay rights movement. And while gays and lesbians, particularly those who happen to be white, have benefited from the steady progression toward cultural acceptance, the trans women who led those protests remain mostly in the shadows.

Perhaps this is why the demonstrations began just when South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg was about to speak. Buttigieg, an openly gay cisgender white male, has become a regular on Sunday morning talk shows and is a bit of a pop culture media darling. The discussion was being moderated by Anderson Cooper, another openly gay cisgender white male who, as a public figure, has seemed to find a high level of acceptance.
There is no question that coming out and living one's truth can be a difficult journey regardless of race or gender identity. But it is far too easy for people of a station and privilege in life—and for viewers who may pat themselves on the back for their broadmindedness -- to not acknowledge the struggles of the trans women of color who have not been as readily accepted despite their historical activism in the movement.
Buttigieg approached this as the protesters were removed: ""I do want to acknowledge what these demonstrators were speaking about, which is the epidemic of violence against black trans women in this country right now."" Ending that epidemic, he said, requires ""lifting up its visibility and speaking to it.""
To his credit, Cooper took a moment to applaud the protesters for their demonstration and acknowledge the lack of media coverage given to the trans community.
Cooper was right: If tens of cisgender gay white males were murdered in a year, it would undoubtedly garner much more media attention.

We should credit the candidates who were asked about their strategy to stop men from killing trans women of color (as one audience member yelled while Senator Kamala Harris was on stage) for at least being well versed on the issue. They spoke of the need to have a Department of Justice that seriously investigated these crimes. They spoke of the need to have an education secretary who was committed to protecting transgender students, something the current secretary has been reluctant to do. More importantly they looked these disenfranchised women in their eyes and they listened to their pain, something the community at large has not been particularly good at doing since the decline of AIDS.
Historically, because of family rejection and housing discrimination, many transgender people do not have the resources to attend a fabulous fundraiser with the promise of one-on-one time with a candidate. In fact, because of these civil rights violations, many must turn to sex work just to survive, a predicament that makes them vulnerable to the violence that has led to so many deaths.
They have been reliant on their gay and lesbian brothers and sisters with deep pockets to take their concerns up the socioeconomic ladder and quite honestly, they have been sorely let down.
Consumed with marriage equality, iconography, and heteronormativity, much of the past 50 years in the movement has been an exercise in white, cisgender, gay advancement despite its black and Latino transgender beginnings. Because of this, the policy improvements the candidates proposed on this historic night are somewhat secondary to the fundamental fight that still needs to be fought.
The long-standing running joke used to be that when it came to the LGBT movement, the T was silent. As uncomfortable as it was at times, on this historic night, that was not the case—and an important step.
Fifty years ago, trans women of color took to the streets in hopes of forcing America to fulfill its promise of equality. The town hall protests, on the eve of national coming out day, reminded everyone that one group, in particular, is dying for that promise to be fulfilled.

The tweaked language can be seen in the church's ""Handbook 2,"" which says: ""Churches are dedicated for the worship of God and as havens from the cares and concerns of the world. With the exception of current law enforcement officers, the carrying of lethal weapons on church property, concealed or otherwise, is prohibited.""
The previous rule said the carrying of lethal weapons was inappropriate.
Lethal weapons include a number of possible items including guns, said Daniel Woodruff,a spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The handbook update took effect in the first week of August, Woodruff said, but the change will be formally communicated to local Church leaders as new meetinghouse safety guidelines in the near future.
Those leaders will then be responsible for sharing the guidelines with their members, he added.
The change applies to the entire church, but due to a Texas law change regarding firearms in places of worship, a letter referencing the prohibition was recently sent to church leaders in Texas and shared with members, Woodruff said.
Next month, a new law will go into effect in Texas which will allow licensed handgun owners to legally carry their weapons in places of worship.
It's one of a string of new firearm laws that will take effect across Texas next month, further loosening gun restrictions in a state that already has some of the most lax weapons laws in the nation.


One of those laws will disallow school districts from prohibiting licensed gun owners -- including school employees -- from storing a firearm or ammunition in a locked vehicle on a school parking lot, as long as they're not in plain view. Another will allow foster homes to store firearms and ammunition in a safe and secure place for personal protection.
The handbook tweak isn't the first change the church has seen in recent years.
It's undergone many others, including dropping the moniker ""Mormon,"" cutting an hour from Sunday church meetings, allowing missionaries to contact their families more often, ending the church's 100-year association with the Boy Scouts and dropping an anti-LGBT policy from 2015, saying children of same-sex couples can be baptized.

https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/31/opinions/nazi-salute-west-virginia-cadets-photo-filipovic/index.html,"There is a tiny bit of good news at the tail end of the trash fire that was 2019: A Nazi salute will, in some corners of America, get you fired.

All of those correctional cadets from the West Virginia Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation Basic Training Class 18 who were photographed apparently giving a Nazi salute will be fired, thanks to the decision by West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice to approve a recommendation from an internal report on the incident.
""We have a lot of good people in the Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety,"" Justice said in a statement. ""But this incident was completely unacceptable.""
He said three staff members at the training academy will be fired. And four instructors who did not report the photograph will be suspended without pay.
Two trainers and a cadet were canned earlier, while 34 others were suspended without pay during the investigation of the photo, which was released Dec. 5 (with faces blurred) by the state's Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety. Some cadets said that they were ordered to raise their arm in a salute to a training instructor for their class identified only as ""Instructor Byrd."" 
Byrd told a member of the secretarial staff, according to the investigation by the department and its Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation, to caption the photo ""Hail Byrd,"" ""because I'm a hard-ass like Hitler.""
There are two threads worth pulling apart here. First is the most obvious one: the glorification of Nazi violence. Hitler wasn't a ""hard-ass;"" he was a genocidal dictator who ordered and oversaw some of the worst atrocities in modern history (he was also, as most tyrants are, a pathetic and fearful little man). Hitler and his Nazis killed some 6 million Jews, and millions of others: people with disabilities, Roma people, gay people and those who dared stand up to him.


That's not a ""hard-ass."" That's a vicious, murderous anti-Semite and a man so vile it's hard to come up with appropriately derogatory descriptors. To encourage cadets to think of you like Hitler and, by extension, of themselves like Nazis? That's poison.
Anti-Semitism remains pervasive in the United States and around the world, surfacing in atrocities such as the stabbings carried out in Monsey, New York, last weekend. According to the New York Police Department and the Anti-Defamation League, anti-Semitic hate crimes are on the rise.
So good riddance to all of these Nazi-saluting cadets.
But there's something else here, too. If the cadets are gesturing like Nazis -- glorifying their obedience to a ""hard-ass"" leader, who exactly are they all collectively terrorizing? Nazis, after all, are menacing only because they have blameless, helpless victims.
These cadets were training to work in West Virginia's prisons, jails and juvenile correctional facilities. Correctional cadets are already entering a field where abuse is rife and where a sadistic streak of authoritarianism can too often be allowed to flourish.
West Virginia is 93% white, but, according to data from the advocacy group Prison Policy Initiative, nearly a third of its prisoners are black. Hispanic people are also over-represented in West Virginia correctional facilities. Prison guards have been accused of rape and other assaults in West Virginia prisons.
The treatment of prison populations, including children, is at the whim of corrections officers. Rogue guards have been known across the country to abuse their power and act with tremendous brutality toward inmates --too often effectively protected from punishment by union rules.
Within this larger context, this incident suggests the problem likely doesn't begin and end with these cadets, who, predictably, say they were just following orders -- in this case, from Instructor Byrd.
Firing everyone involved is the correct first step, but it can't be the last one. The West Virginia Department of Corrections needs an expansive investigation into the culture that made this photo seem like an acceptable idea in the first place -- however clueless the adult cadets claim to have been.
What else are cadets learning about their role supervising and keeping safe the incarcerated population? How are working guards treating the incarcerated? Are people in prison being kept safe in West Virginia, or is the tolerance for cruelty that this photo arguably suggests already being leveraged against people with few avenues for reporting, and who stand to pay a steep price for speaking out?
The cabinet secretary of West Virginia's Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety and the commissioner of the department's Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation both recommended additional training, though neither was specific.
The photo was an ugly symbol of a murderous ideology. But firing the people who raised their arms in a Nazi salute does not root out any of the potential underlying rot among those in positions of authority over future key players in America's justice system. West Virginia needs to dig deeper to find what's festering underneath.
