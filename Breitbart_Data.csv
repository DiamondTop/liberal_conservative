0,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Mexican authorities are in a state of high alert over an intelligence alert from U.S. authorities warning about a possible suicide bomber traveling north with a group of four others. Breitbart published a redacted copy of the initial intelligence report from U.S. Border Patrol.



Earlier this week, Breitbart published an exclusive copy of the leaked official document from a source operating under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The document, prepared by an intelligence unit within U.S. Border Patrol, quoted information Border Patrol officials received from ICE Homeland Security Investigations about four men and a woman. The woman is a suspected suicide bomber who traveled through Central America into Mexico and is reportedly headed to the U.S.-Mexico border just south of where California and Arizona meet. The area is knows as named San Luis Rio Colorado. The group is expected to cross into California through the All-American Canal “in the coming days.”

In the border city of Mexicali, Public Safety Director Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez confirmed to Mexico’s Revista Proceso that they were in a state of alert as federal and state authorities in Mexico began “Operation Border Shield” as a preventive measure and not a reactionary one.
In the Proceso article written by Jesusa Cervantes, Mexico reportedly received the alert from DHS but does not credit Breitbart News for first publishing that there was an alert in the first place. In a similar fashion, a TV report from KYMA News by Alexandra Rangel, quotes the Mexican police chief and tried to obtain a statement from U.S. Customs and Border Protection but makes no mention of Breitbart News’ initial report and the document published one day prior. Breitbart News contacted Rangel for comment for not crediting the initial report. No response has been received.

1,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Over a dozen Saudi servicemen stationed at U.S. military bases are set to be kicked out of the United States following an inquiry prompted by the deadly shooting at Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, according to a Saturday evening report. Some of the foreign military members are said to be accused of ties to extremists and possessing child pornography.
CNN reports:


The Saudis are not accused of aiding the 21-year-old Saudi Air Force second lieutenant who killed three American sailors in the December shooting, two sources said, but some are said to have connections to extremist movements, according to a person familiar with the situation.
A number are also accused of possessing child pornography, according to a defense official and the person familiar with the situation. Spokespeople for the FBI and Justice Department declined to comment.
About a dozen Saudi trainees at the Pensacola base had been confined to their quarters as the FBI investigated the shooting as a potential terror attack, and the Pentagon initiated a review of all Saudi military trainees in the country, numbering around 850 students.
On December 6th, Mohammed Alshamrani, a second lieutenant in the Saudi Air Force, killed three people and injured eight others after opening fire at the base, a gun-free zone. Alshamrani is believed to have posted the phrase “the countdown has started” on his social media accounts on September 11, 2019, and also reportedly described non-Muslims as “infidels.”

The Saudi national, who was killed during his rampage by a sheriff’s deputy, had also reportedly criticized U.S. military action.
“He basically is saying the same thing that many terrorists before him has said, that the U.S. is the enemy because they attack Muslims overseas or they help other countries attack Muslims overseas. And that’s their justification to attack us,” former FBI agent Brad Garrett said.
The Department of Justice is expected to rule that the shooting was “terrorism,” one U.S. official told CNN.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has said Saudi Arabia, which has pledged its full support over the shooting, will “owe a debt” to victims of a deadly attack.
“One of the things I talked to [President Donald Trump] about is, given this is a foreign national and employee of a foreign service, is … The government of Saudi Arabia needs to make things better for these victims,” De Santis told reporters at the time. “I think they’re gonna owe a debt here given that this is one of their individuals.”"
2,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"An email proves disgraced ex-FBI Director James Comey personally approved an FBI effort to have the wild and unsubstantiated “golden showers” claim about President Trump included in material to be considered for publication in the U.S. Intelligence Community’s official report on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
The Comey email, which has not received media attention until now, was revealed inside the Justice Department’s recently released 476-page Inspector General report on the FBI’s Russia collusion investigation.


The IG report further discloses a separate email in which Andrew McCabe, who served under Comey as the FBI’s deputy director, specifically wanted dossier author Christopher Steele’s unverified “pee” charges against Trump to be included in the body of the January 6, 2017 U.S. Intelligence Community report, known as the ICA, assessing alleged Russian interference efforts.
McCabe opposed a CIA compromise to only reference Steele’s controversial dossier in an appendix of the ICA report, with McCabe arguing for it to be included in the body of the report where it would clearly get more attention.
In his email on the subject, McCabe seemed to be speaking on behalf of Comey’s FBI, using the noun “we.”

Referencing Steele’s charges, McCabe wrote:
We oppose CIA’s current plan to include it as an appendix; there are a number of reasons why I feel strongly that it needs to appear in some fashion in the main body of the reporting, and I would welcome the chance to talk to you about it tomorrow.
Comey himself personally approved of the inclusion of Steele’s wild claims in the ICA assessment, an email published in the IG report discloses. The IG report relates that the CIA did not want Steele’s claims to be included at all, downgrading Steele’s charges to “internet rumor.” Still, Comey and McCabe pushed for the wild anti-Trump claims to be part of the ICA assessment, which was ultimately made public.
The ICA was a joint effort of the FBI, NSA and CIA with oversight from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which published the report.
Comey, former CIA Director turned anti-Trump activist John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence and Trump critic James Clapper have been the subjects of a dispute over which top Obama administration officials advocated for the infamous Steele dossier to be utilized as evidence in the ICA report.
Now the IG report cites emails from Comey and McCabe as well as testimony from members of the intelligence community showing it was Comey and McCabe who lobbied for Steele’s wild sexual claims about Trump to be part of the official ICA probe.

Steele’s dossier infamously claimed that while Trump was staying in the presidential suite at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Moscow in 2013, the real estate mogul hired “a number of prostitutes to perform a ‘golden showers’ (urination) show in front of him.” The dossier claimed Trump wanted to “defile” the bed because he learned that President Obama had used the same suite during a trip to Russia.
Steele was hired to produce his material for Fusion GPS, which was paid for its anti-Trump work by Trump’s primary political opponents, namely Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie law firm.

A December 16, 2016 email from the FBI’s Intel Section Chief made clear McCabe was arguing for the wild sexual claims to be included in the official ICA report.
Referring to McCabe as “deputy director,” the section chief wrote that McCabe wanted “details like the potential compromising material, etc.” to be included in the FBI’s official submission to the intelligence community for material to be considered for the ICA report.
That same day, the FBI’s Intel Section Chief sent an email to other FBI officials including controversial FBI employee Peter Strzok. The missive contained a draft of the FBI’s official submission to the ICA effort that included Steele’s unsubstantiated claims.

The next day, Comey completed his review of the FBI’s official submission and personally approved of Steele’s dossier reports to be included in the ICA assessment.
In an email to Strzok, McCabe and others, Comey described a phone call he had with then Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, writing that he told Clapper to include the Steele reports.
“Looks okay to me,” Comey wrote, approving of the FBI submission that encompassed Steele’s dossier charges.
Comey’s email continued:
FYI: During a secure call last night on this general topic, I informed the DNI that we would be contributing the [Steele] reporting (although I didn’t use that name) to the IC [Intelligence Community] effort. I stressed that we were proceeding cautiously to understand and attempt to verify the reporting as best we can, but we thought it important to bring it forward to the IC effort.
Comey went on to document that he vouched for Steele’s so-called sources while admitting that he didn’t tell Clapper about FBI efforts to verify the claims. The FBI at the time could not verify the charges.
Comey wrote:
I told him the source of the material, which included salacious material about the President-Elect, was a former [REDACTED] who appears to be a credible person with a source and sub-source network in position to report on such things, but we could not vouch for the material. (I said nothing further about the source or our efforts to verify).
Comey may have even more egg on his face for vouching for Steele’s alleged sources following the publication of the IG report, which relates that Comey’s own FBI found serious sourcing problems and glaring issues with the way Steele reported the “pee” claim.
Meanwhile, Comey’s FBI fought back against attempts by the CIA to remove Steele’s claims from the ICA report.
The IG report reveals the CIA expressed concern about using the Steele election reporting in the ICA assessment, with the CIA viewing Steele’s claims to be no more than “internet rumor.”
States the IG report:
The Supervisory Intel Analyst explained that the CIA believed that the Steele election reporting was not completely vetted and did not merit inclusion in the body of the report. The Intel Section Chief stated that the CIA viewed it as “internet rumor.”
That’s when McCabe stepped in and strongly pushed for Steele’s claims to be including in the body of the ICA report and not relegated to the appendix as part of a comprise with the CIA.
“McCabe’s view did not prevail,” the IG report relates. “The final ICA report was completed early in the first week of January 2017, and included a short summary and assessment of the Steele election reporting, which was incorporated in an appendix.”
Comey, Brennan and Clapper were previously the subjects of a dispute about which senior official advocated for Steele’s dossier to be included in the ICA report.
The fiasco was kicked into high gear after Fox News cited “sources familiar with the records” pointing to an email chain from late-2016 showing Comey allegedly telling FBI employees that it was Brennan who insisted that the anti-Trump dossier be included in a January 6, 2017 U.S. Intelligence Community report, known as the ICA, assessing Russian interference efforts.
A former CIA official, clearly defending Brennan, shot back at the assertion, instead claiming that it was Brennan and Clapper who opposed a purported push by Comey to include the dossier charges in the ICA.
The IG report shows it was indeed Comey who pushed for the dossier’s inclusion in the ICA material.

3,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iranian demonstrators defied a heavy police presence Sunday night to protest their country’s days of denials that it shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane carrying 176 people, the latest unrest to roil the capital amid soaring tensions with the United States.
Videos posted online showed protesters shouting anti-government slogans and moving through subway stations and sidewalks, many near Azadi, or Freedom, Square after an earlier call for people to demonstrate there. Other videos suggested similar protests were taking place in other Iranian cities.


Riot police in black uniforms and helmets earlier massed in Vali-e Asr Square, at Tehran University and other landmarks. Revolutionary Guard members patrolled the city on motorbikes, and plainclothes security men were also out in force. People looked down as they walked briskly past police, hoping not to draw attention to themselves.
The plane crash early Wednesday killed everyone on board, mostly Iranians and Iranian-Canadians. After initially pointing to a technical failure and insisting the armed forces were not to blame, authorities on Saturday admitted to accidentally shooting it down in the face of mounting evidence and accusations by Western leaders.
Iran downed the flight as it braced for possible American retaliation after firing ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq housing U.S. forces. The missile attack, which caused no casualties, was a response to the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top general, in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad. But no retaliation came.

Iranians have expressed anger over the downing of the plane and the misleading explanations from senior officials in the wake of the tragedy. They are also mourning the dead, which included many young people who were studying abroad.
“Even talking about it makes my heart beat faster and makes me sad,” said Zahra Razeghi, a Tehran resident. “I feel ashamed when I think about their families.”
“The denial and covering up the truth over the past three days greatly added to the suffering and pain of the families, and me,” she added.
Another individual, who identified himself only as Saeed, said Iran’s largely state-run media had concealed the cause of the crash for “political reasons.”
“Later developments changed the game, and they had to tell the truth,” he said.

Earlier Sunday, hundreds of students gathered at Tehran’s Shahid Beheshti University to mourn the victims and protest against authorities for concealing the cause of the crash, the semiofficial ISNA news agency reported.
Bahareh Arvin, a reformist member of the Tehran City Council, took to social media to say she was resigning in protest at the government’s lies and corruption. “With the current mechanism, there is no hope of reform,” she said.

Some Iranian artists, including famed director Masoud Kimiai, withdrew from an upcoming international film festival. Two state TV hosts resigned in protest over the false reporting about the cause of the plane crash.
President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for past waves of anti-government demonstrations in Iran, addressed the country’s leaders in a tweet, saying “DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS.”
“The World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching,” he tweeted.

Iranians took to the streets in November after the government hiked gas prices, holding large protests in several cities. The government shut down internet access for days, making it difficult to gauge the scale of the protests and the subsequent crackdown. Amnesty International later said more than 300 people were killed.
A candlelight ceremony late Saturday in Tehran turned into a protest, with hundreds of people chanting against the country’s leaders — including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — and police dispersing them with tear gas. Protests were also held in the city of Isfahan and elsewhere.
Police briefly detained the British ambassador to Iran, Rob Macaire, who said he went to the vigil without knowing it would turn into a protest.
“Can confirm I wasn’t taking part in any demonstrations!” he tweeted. “Went to an event advertised as a vigil for victims of #PS752 tragedy. Normal to want to pay respects — some of victims were British. I left after 5 mins, when some started chanting.”
He said he was arrested 30 minutes after leaving the area.
Britain said its envoy was detained “without grounds or explanation” and in “flagrant violation of international law.”
Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi later tweeted that Macaire was arrested “as an unknown foreigner in an illegal gathering.”
Araghchi said when police informed him that a man was arrested who claimed to be the British ambassador, he didn’t believe them. But he said that once he spoke to Macaire by phone, he realized it was him, and that the ambassador was freed 15 minutes later.
Iran’s Foreign Ministry later summoned the British ambassador over his ”illegal and inappropriate presence” at the protest, it said on its Telegram channel.
Alaeddin Boroujerdi, a member of Iran’s parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy, accused the ambassador of organizing protests and called for his expulsion. Dozens of hard-liners later gathered outside the British Embassy, chanting “Death to England.” They also called for the ambassador to be expelled and the embassy to be closed.
Iranian media, meanwhile, focused on the admission of responsibility for the crash, with several newspapers calling for those responsible to apologize and resign.
The hard-line daily Vatan-e Emrouz bore the front-page headline “A sky full of sadness,” while the Hamshahri daily went with “Shame,” and the IRAN daily said “Unforgivable.”
Mehdi Karroubi, an opposition activist under house arrest, lashed out at Khamenei himself, saying that as commander in chief he was “directly responsible.”
“If you were aware and you let military and security authorities deceive people, then there is no doubt you lack the attributes of constitutional leadership,” he said in a statement.
Criticism of the supreme leader is punishable by up to two years in prison.
Tensions with the United States eased after the ballistic missile attack, when Trump declined to respond and welcomed Iran’s apparent decision to stand down.
The emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, met with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and other officials Sunday in Tehran. Qatar has warm relations with the U.S. and Iran.
Syrian Prime Minister Imad Khamis was also leading a high-level delegation to Iran, including the defense and foreign ministers. Syrian state media described it as an “important visit” in light of recent events, without elaborating. Iran is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad in his country’s civil war, and Soleimani had mobilized militias and coordinated military aid.
Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi was also traveling to Iran, with plans to visit Saudi Arabia the following day. And Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was in Saudi Arabia for talks with King Salman as part of a tour of oil-producing Gulf Arab states aimed at promoting peace."
4,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Samarra (Iraq) (AFP) – Four rockets slammed into an Iraqi airbase north of Baghdad where US troops are based, military sources told AFP on Sunday, with security forces saying four Iraqi airmen were wounded.
A majority of US airmen stationed at the Al-Balad airbase north of Baghdad had already left, the military sources said, following tensions between the US and Iran over the last two weeks.

Military bases hosting US troops have been subject to volleys of rocket and mortar attacks in recent months that have mostly wounded Iraqi forces, but also killed one American contractor last month."
5,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Tehran (AFP) – Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said Sunday it did not aim to kill US troops when it fired a wave of missiles last week at Iraqi bases hosting American forces.
“Our aim was not really to kill enemy soldiers. That was not important,” the Guards’ commander, Hossein Salami, told parliament, referring to last Wednesday’s missile operation launched to avenge the killing of a top Iranian general."
6,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"On Sunday’s broadcast of ABC’s “This Week,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) did not rule out the possibility of bringing new articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.
Host George Stephanopoulos asked, “You said he’s violating the Constitution again and again. Do you think it’s possible that the House might have to file new articles of impeachment?”

7,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"On Sunday’s broadcast of CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) backed Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), saying if the Senate does not subpoena former National Security Advisor John Bolton, the House will.
Host Margaret Brennan said, “The speaker was on another network today and seemed to leave open the idea of subpoenaing John Bolton, the former national security advisor to the president. Is that something you would be looking at? Are you looking at?”


Schiff said, “It is certainly something we are considering.”

He added, “He offered to come forward and testify. There is no reason not to have him testify unless you just want to cover up the president’s wrongdoing. If McConnell succeeds in making this trial the trial without witnesses, it will be the first impeachment trial in history —where the subject of the trial didn’t reside mid-trial —where they didn’t have witnesses. That is not a fair trial. That’s a sham. That’s a coverup.”

8,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"On Sunday’s broadcast of CBS’s “Face the Nation,” former Secretary of State John Kerry said the media has to “stop dealing with questions on Donald Trump’s lies” about the Obama administration’s Iran deal.
Partial transcript as follows:

KERRY: Well, what I was really saying, I think, first of all, Margaret, you are an expert at this. You were there. You know that the president’s tweet is a lie. And the president tweeted this morning, because I am coming on the show and he knew you’d ask me the question or he’d push you in a place where you did ask the question. You and the media, I think, need to call a lie a lie. You know–
BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, I asked you that question in 2015 too.
KERRY: –they didn’t get $150 billion. No- no- no. But let me just finish. You know- yes. And I’ll- I’ll answer that. I was saying clearly some money from the budget of Iran is going to go to the IRGC. It always has. That’s no surprise. But the truth is and President Trump- I- I- well, he probably doesn’t know this, but the fact is his own defense intelligence agency in 2017 testified to the Congress that very, very little money actually went to the IRGC at all. Most of the money went to the economy of Iran, which is precisely what I said and what we all said. So, the IRGC has never had a problem getting money. But the fact is Donald Trump keeps saying they got $150 billion. A lie. He keeps saying that all of that money went to pay for it. It did not. His own defense intelligence agency says most of the money went for the economy of the country. So, you know, we have to stop dealing with questions on Donald Trump’s lies and start dealing with the reality of what is going on. The fact is–
BRENNAN: OK.
KERRY: –the vast proportion of that money–
BRENNAN: Yeah.
KERRY: –went to the economy of Iran and they’re always going to be funding the IRGC. There was no question about that.
BRENNAN: Right.
KERRY: And the IRGC budget has not gone up markedly as a result–
BRENNAN: OK.
KERRY: –of what happened with the agreement, period.

9,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"On Sunday’s broadcast of NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Sen. Rand Paul (D-KY) accused the Trump administration of giving “contradictory information” on why the president ordered the killing of former Iranian Quds force commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani.
Paul said, “I think we’ve heard contradictory information. We’ve heard from the secretary of state that they don’t know where or when but it was imminent. That to me does seem inconsistent. He thinks he can square the circle but to me it seems pretty inconsistent.”


He added, “To me there’s a bigger question too, though, and this is what infuriated me about the briefing is they maintain both in private and in public that a vote by Congress in 2003 or 2002 to go after Saddam Hussein was a vote that allows them to still be in Iraq and do whatever they want, including killing a foreign general from Iran. And I don’t think that’s what Congress meant in 2002. Nor do I think one generation can bind another generation. So my point in being for this war powers debate is that we really need to have a debate about whether we should still be in Iraq or Afghanistan, and there needs to be authorization from Congress.”

10,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"On Sunday’s broadcast of CNN’s “State of the Union,” Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) said he is worried about the “integrity of the information” given by the Trump administration to justify the killing of former Quds force commander Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.
Host Jake Tapper said, “We have heard mixed messages and conflicting stories about the reason for the attack, whether it’s the existential threat that Soleimani posed, vs. imminent attacks, vs. an attack on one embassy, vs. an attack on four embassies.  You and I have sat through this movie before, conflicting, changing information, intelligence juiced in order to justify certain actions.  How worried are you about the integrity of the information we’re being told?”


Lee said, “Well, I’m worried. And as a United States senator and as a voter and citizen, I have learned not to simply take the federal government’s word at face value.”

He added, “I mean, look, we were lied to about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. We were lied to for a couple of decades about what was happening in Afghanistan. We have been lied to about a lot of things.  It’s not to say that the government is always lying or that the people who run it are inherently evil. It’s just that they’re human. And these things do happen.  And so that’s important to ask these questions, to make sure that we know the details.  And insofar as we’re dealing with the inherent tension between the Article 2 commander in chief power enjoyed by the president and the Article 1, Section 8, declaration of war power on the other hand controlled by Congress, members of Congress do need to be apprised of the information underlying a particular decision.”

11,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"President Donald Trump told Fox News TV host Laura Ingraham on Friday his 2021 plans to welcome more foreign graduates will not flood the labor market for U.S. college graduates.
“I have so many companies coming into this country, you’re not going to have to worry about it,” Trump said in the interview, adding, “It is always going to be a shortage … We have so many companies coming in, from Japan … [and] China now is going to start building a lot of things.”


Trump and Ingraham did not find common ground, likely because they were talking about different parts of the immigration problem. Also, neither mentioned Ivanka Trump’s campaign to prod companies to train their own American employees for high-tech jobs.
Ingraham began the exchange by noting American graduates’ salaries have been suppressed by the flood of foreign graduates:
We don’t have a tight labor market. If we had a tight labor market, we would be seeing real increases in wages. I hear that your team is planning on advocating more foreign workers coming in for some of these high-tech companies.
Ingraham rejected business claims of shortages: “We’re seeing a plateauing of wages … There’s a never-ending appetite on the part of corporate America to bring in as much cheap labor as possible to drive down wages.”

“I’m not talking about cheap — I’m talking about brainpower,” Trump responded. “They want to hire smart people. And those people are thrown out of the country — we can’t do that,” he said, referring to foreign graduates of U.S. colleges.
Trump seems to want to help companies import a relatively small number of very clever people, such as Ivy League valedictorians. In contrast, Ingraham is trying to block companies’ effort to cut payrolls by replacing well-paid American professionals with cheap foreign graduates who have just enough skills to get the job done, regardless of quality.
“We have to allow smart people to stay in our country — if you graduate number one in your class at Harvard, [if] you graduate from the Wharton School of Finance,” Trump said. “If we tell smart people to get the hell out, that’s not America first.”
“Yes, that’s a small percentage of what [ccompanies] want,” said Ingraham.
” No, it’s not. It’s a lot,” said Trump.


But business has hired very few valedictorians among the pool of roughly 1.5 million visa workers who now hold jobs sought by American graduates.

In fact, the government does not require U.S companies to hire Americans first, and it does not screen out unskilled foreign workers. The government does not cap foreign hires and does not enforce the loopholed rules which supposedly require foreign workers to be skilled and to be paid market-level wages. Nor does the government even try to curb the large scale nepotism that allows foreign born managers in the United States to import huge numbers of foreign workers who will kick back some of their salaries to their bosses.
For example, the “Optional Practical Training” program was expanded by President G. Bush and President Barack Obama to provide employers with an extra stream of foreign graduates. Foreigners get these OPT work permits by simply enrolling in U.S. colleges, ranging from the elite Stanford University down to the so-called “visa-mill” colleges where many students can speak little English and may do very little study.

DHS posts videos of Indian migrants buying fake documents from ICE's Farmington U. sting operation. The #OPT Optional Practical Training program is an estb.-run labor-trafficking scheme to sideline American graduates. It will expand if #S386 becomes law https://t.co/d2sA6FQ3LK

12,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"On Sunday’s broadcast of CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Secretary of Defense Mark Esper says he “didn’t see” any evidence of  President Donald Trump’s claim that Iran was planning an “imminent” attack on four U.S. embassies.
Partial transcript as follows:

MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that attempt to breach the perimeter and the embassy, but also broadly, the threat that the U.S. was tracking that has been described as imminent time and again by the administration. The president said last week that there was an attempt to blow up the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Here’s specifically what he said on Fox News.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRESIDENT TRUMP: I can reveal that I believe it would have been four embassies, but Baghdad certainly would have been the lead. But I think it would have been four embassy, could have been military bases, could have been a lot of other things, too. But it was imminent. And then all of a sudden he was gone.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BRENNAN: Why couldn’t you share that specific threat with senators in a classified briefing?
ESPER: Well, that information- there was a reference in this- in this exquisite intelligence to an attack on the United States embassy in Baghdad. That information was shared with the Gang of Eight. All that exceptional intelligence shared with the Gang of Eight, not the broader membership of the Congress.
BRENNAN: A specific threat against the U.S. embassy in Baghdad to blow it up–
ESPER: Well, I was–
BRENNAN: –was shared with the Gang of Eight?
ESPER: I was not in that meeting with the Gang of Eight. But I will tell you, I spoke to one of the briefers. What the briefer said to me coming out of that meeting was his assessment that most, if not all the members, thought that the intelligence was persuasive and that they- and that the Gang of Eight did not think that it should be released to the broader members of Congress.
BRENNAN: But, broadly, can you clarify though, was the specific threat that the president shared with Fox News about four U.S. embassies being under threat, also shared with Congress? Why was there a difference?
ESPER: Well, what the president said was he believed that it probably and could have been attacks against additional embassies. I shared that view. I know other members of national security team shared that view. That’s why I deployed thousands of American paratroopers to the Middle East to reinforce our embassy in Baghdad and other sites throughout the region.
BRENNAN: Probably and could have been. That is- that sounds more like an assessment than a specific, tangible threat with a- a decisive piece of intelligence.
ESPER: Well, the president didn’t say there was a tangible- he didn’t cite a specific piece of evidence. What he said is he probably- he believed, could have been—
BRENNAN: Are you saying there wasn’t one?
ESPER: I didn’t see one with regard to four embassies. What I’m saying is I share the president’s view that probably- my expectation was they were going to go after our embassies. The embassies are the most prominent display of American presence in a country.
BRENNAN: The description had been that this was a imminent threat to U.S. personnel and facilities in the region. Is that a more accurate description than what the president provided?
ESPER: Well, what I’ve said publicly, I’ve- I’ve said many times, is that we had information that there was going to be an attack within a matter of days that would be broad in scale, in other words, more than one country, and that it would be bigger than previous attacks, likely going to take us into open hostilities with Iran.
BRENNAN: Is that threat gone?
ESPER: That was orchestrated by Qassem- Qassem Soleimani. He was the one- was- has led the attacks against America for 20 years now, so we had every expectation to believe that this would happen. In fact, a very, very senior person from the  intelligence community said the risk of inaction is greater than the risk of action. That was compelling for me.
BRENNAN: Is that threat gone?
ESPER: That threat has been disrupted. I think what we have to find out now is continue to work to make sure that that threat is completely eliminated.

13,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” White House national security adviser Robert O’Brien made the case the sanctions by the Trump administration on the Iranian regime were working, and noted the economic effects on Iran.
Host Chris Wallace asked, “I want to step back and talk about the whole question of the administration’s strategy to deal with Iran. The U.S. imposed still more sanctions on Iran on Friday. The secretary of state, the secretary of treasury you have two goals. You want Iran to behave like other nations in the world, and you want them to stop their nuclear program. Let’s look at the record so far. The administration has now imposed sanctions on more than 1,000 Iranian companies, organizations, and individuals. Back in September, the Treasury secretary said basically we have cut off all funding to Iran. But instead of caving in, Iran is moving step-by-step out of the nuclear deal and, in recent months, hit six ships, attacked Saudi oil facilities, and set fire to the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. You said this week and in an interview with Axios that you think Iran is now more likely to negotiate, but the maximum pressure campaign, at least if you look at the last six months, has made Iran more aggressive, not less aggressive.”


O’Brien said, “I think the maximum pressure campaign has been working. It’s been demonstrable that it’s working, the Iranian economy is contracting by at least 10%, we haven’t seen that with a modern economy in many, many years, Iran went from producing three to 4 million barrels of oil a day down to 150 to 400,000 barrels depending on the day. Iran is being choked off, Iran is going to have no choice but to come to the table.”

Wallace said, “I agree with all of that, but they haven’t been less aggressive, they haven’t indicated they’re going to come to the table, and fact they have been more aggressive, and they are pulling out of the nuclear deal so why do you say as you have said this weekend you think that they are now more likely to negotiate?”
O’Brien said, “Iran is being choked off, and there is no other way for them to get the money they need to fund the Guard, to fund the regime and their maligned activities, and you are seeing protest breaking out across Iran. And we have seen it for several months, people are fed up with this regime. If Iran wants to maintain a modern country, the mother is going to have to come to the table and negotiate — that’s highly likely.”

14,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Former ESPN personality Jemele Hill attacked the NFL for its lack of black coaches, and blasted the Rooney Rule as an insufficient solution to the problem.
Hill took out after the league in her January 11 article for the Atlantic where she pointed out that the NFL has had a large number head coach jobs open over the last few years and very few went to a black applicant.


“Currently, only three of the NFL’s 32 teams have black head coaches. In the past three years, 19 head-coaching positions were available, but just two black coaches filled those openings,” Hill wrote.
“This hiring cycle has been particularly cruel to black coaches. Five head-coaching jobs were available, and so far, not one has gone to a black candidate,” Hill added.
“Year after year, the hiring pattern shows the ineffectiveness of the league’s Rooney Rule, the policy the NFL instituted in 2003 to address the racial inequities at the head-coaching level,” she said.

The Rooney Rule is a league policy named after late Pittsburgh Steelers Owner Dan Rooney, who helped draft the NFL rule that requires any team looking for a new head coach or team executive to interview at least one minority candidate for consideration.
But Hill feels this rule is practically meaningless. “While well intentioned,” she wrote, “this policy can’t possibly fix the deep-seated culture of exclusion that plagues the league.”
Hill goes on to slam the league for the assumption that black aren’t smart enough to be a head coach.
More than half the players in the NFL are black, and most coaches have played the game at some level. That would seem to be the perfect recipe for black coaches to find success. But most NFL owners have been white men, and they have seldom been willing to let African Americans or Latinos call plays—either on the field or from the sidelines. This is no different from when franchises presumed that black players weren’t smart enough to play quarterback and lacked leadership skills to command men. The league’s paltry record of hiring minority head coaches comes from the same mind-set. And its primary effort to address the problem has been a failure, because a policy can’t compensate for ignorance.
Hill also cited a study by the Global Sport and Education Lab at Arizona State University that showed that 40 percent of the head coaches hired by the NFL came from the ranks of the league’s offensive coordinators, and 91 percent of those hired to be offensive coordinators were white men.
“Even when black coaches follow what appears to be an established blueprint to a head-coaching position, they aren’t guaranteed to be held in the same regard as their white counterparts,” Hill insists.

After laying out a comparison of the experience of several worthy black applicants compared to recent white hires, Hill concluded, “Unfortunately, NFL owners treat white men as their default example of leadership.”
Hill added:
The NFL will never solve this problem if the owners continue to operate as if the lack of minority coaches is somehow the fault of the coaches—and not the system that the league and its owners have purposely constructed. Each franchise makes its own decisions, but the outcome is to exclude minority coaches from head-coaching positions outright—and to hold the few black head coaches to a tougher standard.
Hill also notes that black coaches have not fared well.
“As bad as the most recent hiring cycle has been for minority head coaches,” she wrote, “it may not have been worse than the end of the 2018 season. That’s when five of the eight minority head coaches in the league were all fired. All five of those fired were black.”
Hill concluded, saying, “If the NFL wants to create an equitable system for minority head coaches, the owners can’t rely on a rule to create institutional change. NFL owners must recognize that their lazy stereotypes of black male leadership have created this embarrassing problem. In time, we’ll see whether they have the courage to fix it.”
As if to underline Hill’s analysis, on Sunday the Cleveland Browns hired another team’s offensive coordinator to fill the last open head coach position for the coming 2020 season. That man, Vikings OC Kevin Stefanski, is not black.

15,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"The once prestigious Lancet medical journal has published a bizarre book review asserting that “white Americans continue to mobilise to maintain or extend the exclusive advantages whiteness offers those who can become white.”
The Lancet selected Rhea W. Boyd, a Minority Health Policy Fellow at Harvard’s School of Public Health, to review a 2019 book called Dying of Whiteness by Jonathan Metzl, whose thesis is that “right-wing backlash policies have mortal consequences — even for the white voters they promise to help.”


In his book, Metzl argues that white mortality is up in the United States ever since the 2016 election of Donald Trump, since in order to “maintain an imagined place atop a racial hierarchy,” white Americans who harbor “racial resentment” support policies that seem to limit the freedoms or resources available to non-whites, even though such decisions threaten their own wellbeing as well.
“From expansive gun legislation to broad divestment in government programmes, Metzl characterises white liberties that endanger white lives or imperil white futures as ‘dying of whiteness,’” Boyd observes.
While in her review Boyd fundamentally agrees with Metzl’s contentions, she believes that he is too soft on whites by attributing whites’ self-destructive white political actions to “racial resentment,” which “erases white agency through emotional euphemism.”

“At times, Metzl artfully articulates and historicises the racist origins of white interest in firearm fanaticism and ‘small government’ politics,” Boyd writes. “At others, he turns to ‘racial anxieties,’ racially charged ‘fears,’ or ‘racial resentment’ to describe white people’s political investment in white racial dominance.”
Boyd decries the “common practice” of mis-attributing “white self-destruction and violence to psychological states” or obscuring “the impacts of defending whiteness through emotional euphemisms.”
Drivers of white mortality such as suicide, chronic liver disease, and drug and alcohol poisoning have been described as “diseases of despair,” Boyd notes, while they should be classified as “diseases of disproportionate opportunity (to wield firearms) and access (to prescription opiates).”
The real focus should not be on “mental illness,” “distress,” or “white fragility” underlying increasing white mortality, she contends, but rather on the fundamental “legacy of death in whiteness’s wake.”
It is a mistake — she asserts — to “assert that resentment, despair, or any emotion that arises from being ‘left behind’ accounts for white Americans’ self-destructive actions, violent politics, or declining population health.”

The real population that has been left behind are blacks, she argues, but the difference is that blacks have consistently supported policies that benefit everyone while whites only support policies that benefit themselves.
And so, “despite suffering at every turn of every decade of every century in this nation, generations of Black Americans have sought political reforms that expand electoral participation, increase government protections, and extend public resources beyond their individual or group benefit,” she claims.

Reading between the lines, it seems clear that Boyd believes that the big government policies adopted by the Democrat party benefit the entire population, whereas policies enacted by the GOP only benefit whites.
Thus, she asserts that New Deal politics “forged the greatest advances in social benefits the USA has ever known — from social security and home loan assistance to the administrative precursors to welfare.”
Therefore, “scholars, the media, and the public” have failed to understand “the evolving ways white Americans continue to mobilise to maintain or extend the exclusive advantages whiteness offers those who can become white, even as those advantages place them in increasing proximity to death.”

The simple fact is that “despair isn’t killing white America, the armed defence of whiteness is,” she writes. Thus, death “is the inevitable consequence of the full realisation of structural racism and the exclusive rights and resources it offers those who can become white,” she continues.
Boyd goes on to propose a theory would challenge even the most race-obsessed, in part because it lacks any kind of rational intelligibility.
“For humans to use whiteness to manufacture access and privilege,” Boyd suggests, “they must engineer scarcity and loss. This entanglement between access and scarcity, privilege and loss, means white people’s unearned advantages have always been tethered to a legacy of untold deaths.”
Despite his noble efforts to understand the evils of structural white racism, Boyd suggests, Metzl fails because he anchors it to an emotional foundation, which leads him to conclude that more healthy and self-reflective frameworks of structural whiteness are needed.
In reality, Boyd concludes, the only real solution “is to eliminate whiteness all together.”
The fact that some people think this way is frightening enough. That the Lancet, which once represented serious medical journalism, would decide to publish it points to a devastating deterioration of the institutional academy as reasoned discourse gives way to incoherent ranting.

16,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Twelve individuals were shot Saturday, five of them fatally, in Democrat-controlled Baltimore. CBS reports the shootings began around 2:30 a.m. and ended just before 11 p.m.
The Baltimore Sun reports five fatalities were spread over the course of the entire day, with the first coming as a result of the 2:30 a.m. shooting. The next fatality came approximately 12 hours later, then another as a result of an 8 p.m. shooting, another after an 8:18 p.m. shooting, and the fifth died in the shooting that occurred just before 11 p.m.


On December 29, 2019, Breitbart News reported Baltimore’s homicide rate broke records in 2019. This happened even though Maryland has an “assault weapons” ban, a ban on “high capacity” magazines, registration/fingerprinting requirement for handgun purchasers, and a red flag law, which allows a judge to order the confiscation of firearms from individuals deemed to be a danger to themselves or others.

On July 12, 2017, Breitbart News reported Baltimore’s homicide rate was over twice that of Chicago. At that time, CBS Baltimore reported murders were occurring so frequently that the number of murders in Baltimore was higher than the number in Philadelphia, even though Philadelphia had “two and a half times the population.”
Moreover, Baltimore was seeing more homicides than New York City, although NYC was “almost 14 times larger.”

18,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"America’s adversaries know there is “no worse enemy” than the United States under President Donald Trump’s leadership, assessed Sebastian Gorka, host of the America First radio show and former deputy assistant to the president, offering his remarks in an interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Saturday with host Matt Boyle.
Gorka reflected on his work with Trump’s presidential transition team.

“One of the first things we did on the official presidential transition team working for General Flynn, that great American patriot, and after the election, we were authorized — as transition teams are — to reach out to heads of state who wanted to congratulate the president-elect, and who the president-elect wanted to establish good relations with.”


Gorka continued, “One of the most important objectives we had, especially in the Asia region, was to assure all of our friends [and] allies who had been intimidated for decades by Beijing — by communist China — who were very, very worried after eight years of capitulation under Obama — who traveled the world apologizing for America — our job was to reassure them that America is back, not the imperialistic America, not a colonizing America, but an America that follows in the footsteps of that great saying from President Ronald Reagan; ‘that shining city on a hill.'”
LISTEN:


“One of the things we, first things we planned for president after the inauguration was an extensive trip through the capitals of Asia … to send a very clear message that we’re back,” recalled Gorka. “America is led by somebody who believes in America, and as a certain Marine Corps slogan goes, which I used whenever I was on media to explain the Trump doctrine, under the new president — America, no better friend, no worse enemy — and Beijing, Pyongyang, Moscow, Tehran, now know that very, very well.”
Trump’s political ascendance had redrawn previous political fault lines along geographical and professional lines, determined Gorka, drawing on his experiences during political campaigns events and rallies.
Gorka stated, “When I traveled with the president on to various rally sites, I just remember going into places like Ohio … Youngstown — Steel Valley — Ohio, deep Democrat strongholds, and you had salt-of-the-earth middle-class Americans chanting, ‘U-S-A! U-S-A! Drain the swamp!'”
“This is one of the most significant things of the last four years,” concluded Gorka. “The political landscape has been utterly redrawn, and within that the Democrat Party have become the extremists, the party of Antifa, the party of no borders, the party of supporting Iran.”

19,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"The Iranian government’s admission on Saturday that it shot down a Ukrainian commercial airliner triggered widespread protests nationwide attended by hundreds chanting slogans against the regime and the former head of its foreign terrorist organization, Qasem Soleimani.
An American airstrike eliminated Soleimani, officially the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, in Baghdad this month. The IRGC is a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization; Soleimani led Iran’s terrorism operations abroad and was particularly active in Iraq and Syria against American soldiers.


Iranian officials claimed that the strike against Soleimani resulted in an unknown Iranian soldier shooting down Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) Flight 752 early Wednesday as Tehran shot over a dozen ballistic missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq, a move meant as a response to Soleimani’s demise. Iran had previously claimed a mechanical error had doomed the flight, where all 176 people on board died, and accused the United States of spreading the “false” rumor that the Iranian military shot a Russian Tor missile at it shortly after takeoff to “manipulate stock markets.”
Fars News Agency, an Iranian regime propaganda outlet, has not retracted an article making that claim on its English-language website at press time despite Iranian military officials admitting they shot the plane.
Fars reported on Monday that hundreds of Iranians – a crowd of up to 1,000 in Tehran – responded to the news with protests. The Iranian people entered Saturday already mourning the death of over 50 people in a stampede at a mandatory funeral for Soleimani. NBC News identified at least five other major urban centers – Isfahan, Hamadan, Sari, Rasht, and Babol – as also experiencing protests. Many congregated around university campuses.

The crowds, images of which appeared on social media Saturday, chanted slogans against the regime, urging Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down and tearing up photos of Soleimani. Videos reportedly showed “death to the Islamic Republic” and “death to the dictator” among the chants.

20,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), a staunch ally of President Donald Trump, told Breitbart News on Saturday that he thinks “Trump Derangement Syndrome” is fueling the fervor among Democrats and the establishment media who are criticizing President Trump’s decision to eliminate Iranian Quds Force terrorist leader Qasem Soleimani.
“First and regrettably, the Democrats and the media really do suffer from something like Trump Derangement Syndrome,” Cotton said when asked why the media and left are so upset about this. “They can look at something that is unequivocally good, like removing a terrorist mastermind from the battlefield, and if Donald Trump did it, it must be bad. That’s true in domestic policy for sure, but regrettably it appears to be true in foreign policy and national security matters as well.”


Cotton then ripped the Democrats for veering more leftist than even former President Barack Obama was, noting that openly socialist leaders like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and other far-left Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) are running the show in their party now.
“Second, the Democratic Party has just lurched farther to the left—even farther than Barack Obama himself,” Cotton said. “Some of the comments that Bernie Sanders has made, saying that Qasem Soleimani’s killing by Donald Trump is like Vladimir Putin killing dissidents or journalists – or Elizabeth Warren refusing to call Qasem Soleimani a terrorist but referring to him as a high-ranking government official of a foreign country –  goes to show just how far they have lurched to the left and just how far down the path they have committed to appeasement with Iran. You can see the difference over the last two weeks: Appeasement during the Obama era got us Iran rampaging through the Middle East, targeting our troops, undermining friendly governments. Confrontation, action—by killing Qasem Soleimani—got Iran to pull in its horns, at least temporarily.”
After noting too that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi compared Trump eliminating Soleimani to Iran trying to take out Vice President Mike Pence, Cotton ripped former Vice President Joe Biden as just as extreme on the left as Sanders or Warren—a sign that the Democrat Party has shifted to radical extremes.

“Remember, too, Joe Biden—the supposedly centrist or moderate candidate for president—said it was a terrible mistake and destabilized the Middle East when in fact it was Iran led by men like Qasem Soleimani who have been destabilizing the Middle East through the decades,” Cotton said. “I’m reminded by what Secretary of Defense Bob Gates said about Joe Biden: He has been wrong about literally every foreign policy question for four decades, only now we have to correct it and say wrong for five decades.”
Cotton this week published an op-ed in the New York Times laying out his reasoning as to why President Trump was justified in ordering the strike that eliminated Soleimani. Asked about it, and to summarize his case for the legal justification of the strike, Cotton explained that Soleimani was a U.S.-designated terrorist who had killed hundreds of Americans in Iraq and was there plotting to kill more.
“Qasem Soleimani and the terrorist organization he led, the Quds Force, are U.S.-designated foreign terrorists,” Cotton said. “Qasem Soleimani was in a foreign country, Iraq, which is an active field of conflict where our troops are present based on the invitation of the host government, specifically to plot the deaths of more Americans. Our troops have the inherent right to self-defense, wherever they are present, and the Commander has the authority under his Constitutional powers as Commander in Chief to protect our troops and to protect our interests.”
Cotton, who served in Iraq as a platoon commander in the 101st Airborne Division before his election to Congress, further explained that Soleimani has not only killed hundreds of Americans in Iraq but has also been behind many other acts of brutality against the United States over the years.
“In Iraq alone, over the last 17 years, Qasem Soleimani killed over 600 Americans,” Cotton said. “As you say, he specialized in a particularly lethal kind of roadside bomb called the Explosively Formed Penetrator. I can tell you in my time over there as a platoon leader in the 101st Airborne in Iraq, the EFP was the single most deadly weapon we faced and there was really no defense against it. If you hit one, it would kill you or significantly hurt you and your troops. But, Qasem Soleimani has a lot more American blood on his hands than just in Iraq. They’ve been conducting the same kinds of attacks in Afghanistan. They’ve supported anti-American militias in places like Syria. He and his proxies have been behind attacks on our embassies in places like Beirut, along with the Marine barracks in Beirut. And remember he was met at the Baghdad airport not by an Uber driver but by Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, his chief terror proxy in Iraq who himself was responsible for the bombing of our embassy in Kuwait in 1983. Qasem Soleimani and his terror proxies have the blood of literally thousands of Americans on their hands.”

Earlier this week, Iran responded to Soleimani’s killing by launching a dozen ballistic missiles at U.S. installations in Iraq—causing minimal damage and killing nobody. In response, President Trump addressed the nation flanked by military leaders laying out how the U.S. will impose new sanctions on the Islamic Republic of Iran in the wake of all this—and, as Cotton notes, making clear what the boundaries are from here on forward.
“The president’s red line remains clear: If Iran harms any American, anywhere, whether directly or through its proxies, the United States will hold Iran accountable and there will be severe consequences,” Cotton said. “We will not try to deny that they are responsible for attacks through terrorist proxies and we will not fail in the face of Iranian aggression. We shouldn’t assume that Iran is going to change its colors forever. Yes, they are now afraid again of the United States. But in a month or three months or six months, we shouldn’t be surprised if Iran begins to test the boundaries again. Fortunately, though, Iran now knows there are very firm and very clear boundaries that they cannot step across, unlike was the case during the Obama era.”
What’s more, the night Iran launched the ballistic missiles at U.S. based in Iraq, the Islamic Republic of Iran also shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet killing nearly 200 people on board in the crash that resulted. Iran originally denied it, but has since—as of Saturday morning—admitted being behind shooting the plane down, blaming incompetent personnel. Cotton dismissed attacks by some on the American left that Trump was somehow responsible for Iran doing this, noting that Iran is “solely responsible” for shooting down the plane.
“You mentioned the terrible and tragic shoot down of the Ukrainian airlines flight,” Cotton said. “Iran just admitted that they were responsible for that this morning. They blamed it on incompetent air defense personnel. Iran is solely responsible for that tragedy that killed more than 170 souls. I would also point out that if Iran is so incompetent that they’re shooting down civilian aircraft, why is this a military that we should be fearful of? It is a third rate power that has no chance of standing up to the United States military.”
Cotton, in this exclusive interview with Breitbart News, also addressed the House Democrats’ efforts to impeach President Trump. The House, before Christmas, adopted two Articles of Impeachment against the president after a hurried and controversial process of hearings, secret depositions, and lackluster fact-finding. Since the House adoption of the Articles of Impeachment, Speaker Pelosi has withheld their transmission to the U.S. Senate for a trial, claiming she was trying to leverage Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell into agreeing to Democrat demands for trial witnesses. On Friday, though, Pelosi relented, caved, and gave in, announcing she will transmit the articles to the Senate next week – even though McConnell gave her nothing she asked for.
“I’ve been astonished watching the prosecutors get cold feet after saying the impeachment of the president was an urgent national security priority,” Cotton said. “We expected Speaker Pelosi to send over the Articles of Impeachment eventually. She had locked herself into a box led by her far-left. I gather that the House will send over the Articles next week, and then the Senate will do the job that the House didn’t do, which is the Senate will act as the cool and deliberate sense of the American community, not as the enraged partisan majority you saw in the House of Representatives.”
When the trial happens and concludes in the U.S. Senate, Cotton said, he expects the Senate will acquit President Trump of all charges—and that he expects a bipartisan vote against convicting the president. The House votes against both of the Articles of Impeachment were bipartisan. On the first one, Abuse of Power, two Democrats—Reps. Collin Peterson (D-MN) and now former Democrat Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ)—joined all Republicans in voting against it, while Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) voted “present.” On the second one, Obstruction of Congress, Peterson and Van Drew again voted against it and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) joined them in voting “no,” while Gabbard again voted “present.” Van Drew left the Democrat Party and joined the GOP over this matter.
“I think there is nowhere near the 67 votes required to convict on these Articles of Impeachment,” Cotton said. “As in the House of Representatives, I expect more Democrats will vote with the president than Republicans will vote against the president.”"
21,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Alfredo Ortiz of Job Creators Network writes in FOXBusiness that owing to the policies of the Trump administration leading the nation to energy independence, turmoil in the Middle East no longer threatens the U.S. energy supply: 
One U.S. attribute that distinguishes the current Middle East conflict from past ones is the country’s energy independence. Last September, U.S. petroleum product exports exceeded imports for the first time in recorded history. The Energy Information Agency expects net exports of total crude oil and petroleum to average 570,000 barrels per day in 2020.
Energy independence means that the U.S. has no vital economic interests in the Middle East — a marked change from past conflicts where the country was dependent on a steady flow of Mideast oil to lubricate the domestic economy. This energy security gives the Trump administration more leeway in its foreign policy approach. “We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil,” said President Trump in remarks to the nation on Wednesday.
In the aftermath of the U.S. killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, the price of oil has only increased by a few percent. Contrast this to past conflicts such as the Iraq wars and the Arab oil embargo of 1973, when the oil price skyrocketed. Turmoil in the Middle East no longer threatens the U.S. energy supply. The U.S. now produces and consumes about 20 million barrels of petroleum products a day. Crude oil production has more than doubled over the last decade as the American fracking revolution and good government policy have combined to create countless gushers. The U.S. is now the world’s biggest oil producer. Net petroleum imports have fallen from 10 million barrels a day in 2010 — about 50 percent of consumption — to zero.

24,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Washington (AFP) – Donald Trump warned Iran Sunday against killing protesters who have risen up over the regime’s downing of a civilian airliner as his defense secretary left the door open to talks with Tehran without preconditions.
Trump’s salvo came as Iran’s Islamic regime faced a challenge from angry street protests, having come to the brink of war with the US with a series of tit-for-tat confrontations.


“To the leaders of Iran – DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS,” Trump tweeted, warning the world and “more importantly, the USA is watching.”

26,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Democrats and left-wing legal scholars are debating a new idea floated in the Washington Post on Friday: that Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) should withhold the first article of impeachment (“abuse of power”) and only send the second (“obstruction of Congress”) to the Senate.
Pelosi told her caucus on Friday that she would be prepared to send the articles to the Senate this week, capitulating without winning any concessions from Republicans after delaying the trial for four weeks.


“Never Trump” lawyer George Conway and former acting solicitor general Neal Katyal wrote Friday afternoon in the Post that Pelosi should send the second article of impeachment to the Senate, because the issue of obstruction was “ripe” for trial. They claim there is no further evidence needed to establish that Trump attempted to stop the House from investigating him. (They ignore that the Supreme Court agreed in December to hear a set of cases involving presidential objections to congressional subpoenas in investigations, thus destroying the legal basis for the “obstruction of Congress” argument.)

Conway and Katyal then argue it is impossible to hold a trial on the first article, which alleges Trump abused his power by using U.S. aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, because of a lack of witnesses. They blame Trump for the lack of witnesses — not the House’s refusal to call some of them, or to wait for the court to rule on whether they had to appear.
They argue:
Holding the first article back and letting the second go forward would be a powerful and precise response to McConnell’s unprecedented attempts to avoid committing to a real trial. It makes practical sense but also highlights what’s at stake here. Trump would be forced to undergo two impeachment trials instead of one — but that’s a fair price for him to pay for his attempts to hide evidence from the American people.
The House will hold procedural votes on the articles this week.

27,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Saturday during her program’s “Opening Argument” segment, Fox News Channel’s Jeanine Pirro excoriated House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who she described as being publicly humiliated in her handling of the impeachment, particularly concerning Pelosi’s efforts to attempt to gain an advantage over Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).
Pirro said Pelosi’s short-comings were a sign of a weak impeachment case, noting the California Democrat was coming away empty-handed after her standoff with McConnell in attempting to withhold the articles.


“In the end Nancy, your investigation was a partisan political joke on how to manipulate the truth, and then have everybody swear to it,” she said. “And after all the rushing, what did your dithering gain in your unprecedented refusal to forward the articles of impeachment to the Senate? Did you gain a political advantage? What did you get out of waiting, other than losing votes to the Republican Party? Admit it. You caved after Mitch McConnell gave you a deadline to either send over the articles of impeachment or simply watch the Senate move forward without them. That’s right, Nancy. You simply caved. That’s what happens when there’s no case. Who said you were smart anyway?”

28,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"The government will not have 450 miles of border wall built by the end of 2020, homeland security chief Chad Wolf said at a press event, where he touted the completed construction of 100 miles of wall.
“I can tell you right now that we remain confident that we are on track to [reach] 400, 450 miles that are either completed or under construction by the end of 2020,” Wolf told attendees at a press conference in Yuma, Arizona.


The “or under construction” language admits there is little likelihood that the Department of Homeland Security will be able to meet President Donald Trump’s goal of building 500 miles of wall by November, despite the release this week of $3.6 billion in Pentagon money for the wall project.
On December 25, 2018, Trump told reporters “It is my hope to have this done, completed, all 500 to 550 miles, to have it either renovated or brand new, by election time.”


Trump’s deputies recently echoed the goal. In August 2019, the Washington Post reported:
CBP and Pentagon officials insist they remain on track to complete about 450 miles of fencing by the election. Of that, about 110 miles will be added to areas where there is currently no barrier. The height of the structure will vary between 18 and 30 feet, high enough to inflict severe injury or death from a fall.
As Wolf admitted the wall would not be completed, he said the construction of the first 100 miles is a big win:

We have built more walls in the three years of this administration than the entire eight years of the last administration. So I think that’s first and foremost. 
We have reduced time [delays] from appropriations [in Congress] to shovel-in-the-ground from two years to nine months, and we also continue to work with our great partners with the Corps of Engineers to make sure that we have the land acquisition needed to build to build the wall. I will also say that we’re continuing to assess the 30-day … delay that we had in that a court injunction. 
So that’s going to impact as well. But I can tell you right now that we remain confident that we are on track to 400, 450 miles that are either completed or under construction by the end of 2020.

The first 100 miles of construction has replaced easily-bypassed walls, including the low walls that were constructed from the airstrip landing mats designed to help pave military airfields.
The shortcomings in DHS’s wall-building projects, however, are partly offset by huge diplomatic deals that Trump and DHS officials have won with the countries south of the U.S. border.
The main deal with Mexico has allowed officials to send more than 55,000 Central American migrants back to Mexico, so preventing them from getting U.S. jobs as they wait for much-delayed asylum hearings. The denial of U.S. jobs is a huge deterrent to migrants, because migrants know they will not be able to repay their smuggling loans if they cannot get U.S. jobs.
Other deals will allow officials to fly arriving migrants to other countries throughout the region, and so prevent them from even filing for asylum in the United States. “Hondurans and Salvadorans get sent to Guatemala and Guatemalans get sent to Honduras,” said a tweet from Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, an advocate at the pro-migration American Immigration Council. “None of them get to apply for asylum here.”
Wolf told the press conference that 96 migrants were recently flown to Guatemala so they could seek asylum in that country. Only one migrant did seek asylum, while the others went back to their home countries, he said.
“75 Hondurans and 53 Salvadorans have been sent to Guatemala as part of the Asylum Cooperation Agreement with the United States,” said a January 10 tweet from a journalist in Central America. “Of those 128 people, only 9 have applied for refuge in Guatemala. Of those 9, 5 have abandoned the process.”

29,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Texas Governor Greg Abbott (R) is the first governor in the United States to halt refugee resettlement in his state, a move that comes as the state has been inundated over the last three decades with mass immigration.
For Fiscal Year 2020, President Donald Trump will continue cutting refugee admissions by reducing former President Barack Obama’s refugee inflow by at least 80 percent. This reduction would mean a maximum of 18,000 refugees can be resettled in the U.S. between October 1, 2019, and September 30, 2020. This is merely a numerical limit and not a goal federal officials are supposed to reach.


Coupled with the refugee reduction, Trump signed an executive order that gives localities, counties, and states veto power over whether they want to resettle refugees in their communities.
In a letter to the Trump administration, Abbott said Texas had taken more refugees than any other state in the U.S., noting that state taxpayers and officials have “been left by Congress to deal with disproportionate migration issues…”
Abbott wrote in his letter:

Texas is one of the most welcoming states for refugees seeking to escape dangers abroad. since FY2010, more refugees have been received in Texas than in any other state. In fact, over that decade, roughly 10% of all refugees resettled in the United States have been placed in Texas. Even today, the process of resettling continues for many of these refugees. [Emphasis added]
In addition to accepting refugees all these years, Texas has been left by Congress to deal with disproportionate migration issues resulting from a broken federal immigration system. In May 2019, for example, around 100,000 migrants were apprehended crossing this state’s southern border. In June 2019, individuals from 52 different countries were apprehended here. And in FY2018, the apprehensions included citizens from disparate countries like China, Iran, Kenya, Russia, and Tonga. Texas continues to have to deal with the consequences of an immigration system that Congress has failed to fix. [Emphasis added]
At this time, the state and non-profit organizations have a responsibility to dedicate available resources to those who are already here, including refugees, migrants, and the homeless — indeed, all Texans. As a result, Texas cannot consent to initial refugee resettlement for FY2020. This decision does not deny any refugee access to the United States. Nor does it preclude a refugee from later coming to Texas after initially settling in another state. [Emphasis added]
Texas has carried more than its share in assisting the refugee resettlement process and appreciates that other states are available to help with these efforts. [Emphasis added]
Since 2005, more than 81,600 refugees have been resettled in the state of Texas — a level of refugees that outpaces the entire population of Portland, Maine. The majority of those refugees have been resettled in the state’s major cities like Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, Houston, and Fort Worth.
Refugees resettled in Texas over the last 15 years have mostly arrived from Afghanistan, Bhutan, Somalia, Syria, Sudan, Iraq, and Iran. For example, nearly 15,000 refugees, alone, have arrived in Texas from Iraq. Another nearly 4,000 have arrived from Iran.
Despite previous opposition to the refugee resettlement program by Republicans, Abbott is the only Republican governor to halt the refugee flow to his state with 19 other Republican governors asking the Trump administration to continue resettling refugees in their communities.
The Republican governors who have asked for more refugee resettlement include:

Mike DeWine of Ohio
Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas
Kim Reynolds of Iowa
Charlie Baker of Massachusetts
Gary Herbert of Utah
Doug Burgum of North Dakota
Chris Sununu of New Hampshire
Doug Ducey of Arizona
Eric Holcomb of Indiana
Bill Lee of Tennessee
Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma
Pete Ricketts of Nebraska
Kristi Noem of South Dakota
Jim Justice of West Virginia
Mike Parson of Missouri
Brad Little of Idaho
Larry Hogan of Maryland
Mike Dunleavy of Alaska
Phil Scott of Vermont

An exclusive memo obtained by Breitbart News reveals how Republican governors like Gov. Hutchinson of Arkansas are defending their decision to admit refugees by claiming that the state will have more involvement in the process  than ever.

Hutchinson has also suggested that refugees to Arkansas will likely be nationals who have cooperated with the U.S. military and are thus being persecuted for that reason. Those nationals, though, primarily arrived through the various Special Immigrant Visa categories and not through the refugee resettlement program.
Likewise, states are not allowed to choose the refugees they receive nor are state officials given background profiles of each refugee.
Refugee contractors have a vested interest in making sure as many refugees are resettled across the U.S. as possible because their annual federally funded budgets are contingent on the number of refugees they resettle. Those refugee contractors include:
Church World Service (CWS), Ethiopian Community Development Council (ECDC), Episcopal Migration Ministries (EMM), Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), International Rescue Committee (IRC), U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI), Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services (LIRS), U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), and World Relief Corporation (WR).
Refugee resettlement costs American taxpayers nearly $9 billion every five years, according to the latest research. Over the course of five years, an estimated 16 percent of all refugees admitted will need housing assistance paid for by taxpayers.

30,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"An English regional counter-terrorism policing unit listed Extinction Rebellion in an anti-extremism guidance note that includes Islamist and far-right terror organisations. Authorities said they would recall the document after inquiries from the left-liberal Guardian newspaper.
The Guardian has revealed that Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE) had included Extinction Rebellion in a 12-page booklet entitled Safeguarding Young People and Adults from Ideological Extremism.


The document was aimed at teachers and police when on the lookout for signs of radicalisation in young people in the referral process for Prevent, the government’s programme that intervenes primarily with youths at risk of extremism or committing acts of terror.
Other groups and ideologies listed in the document include the banned far-right National Action, extreme Satanism, the proscribed Islamist group Al-Muhajiroun, and animal rights extremism. The newspaper reports that national counter-terrorism officials said that the document was produced at a local level and believe that Extinction Rebellion’s inclusion was a mistake.
On Extinction Rebellion, the document advises authorities to be on the look-out for “propaganda materials” and the group’s logo. The CTPSE also advises being aware of young people discussing “NVDA” (non-violent direct action) and pupils who “neglect to attend school” or “participate in planned school walkouts” — a reference to the school climate strikes popularised by climate wunderkind and Extinction Rebellion supporter Greta Thunberg.

The document also advises that signs of extremism include expressing a desire to be arrested or “admiration for those arrested for protest activity” as well as those speaking in “strong or emotive terms about environmental issues like climate change, ecology, species extinction, fracking, airport expansion or pollution”.
On why the regional counter-terrorism unit said that the group should be considered a “threat”, it said: “Anti-establishment philosophy that seeks system change underlies its activism; the group attracts to its events school-age children and adults unlikely to be aware of this. While non-violent against persons, the campaign encourages other law-breaking activities.”
“While concern about climate change is not in itself extreme, activists may encourage vulnerable people to perform acts of violence, or commit such acts themselves,” it added.

Adani is the name of the new operation run by India’s Adani Power which the Australian government approved last year.
Siemens is supposed to provide part of the signalling system for the railway lines necessary for moving the coal out of the plant and to the coast, a move Thunberg has slammed.

32,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Australia’s ‘climate’ fires are fast becoming the biggest fake news scare story of 2020. All the world’s stupidest, most annoying, hand-wringing, virtue-signalling leftists, luvvies, eco-loons, shyster politicians, second-rate activist scientists and other bottom feeders are jumping on the bandwagon.
The fires themselves are all too real: no one is disputing that – or the damage they have done. At least 27 people have been killed – including four firemen; an estimated 15.6 million acres have been burned; hundreds of properties have been destroyed; hundreds of thousands of animals, both livestock and wildlife, have been incinerated.


But the narrative that this has anything to do with ‘climate change’ is the purest eco-propaganda fiction. Here is the truth about Australia’s bush fires.
This is about politics, not climate
Australia’s leftists have never forgiven Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s Liberal Party (ie Australia’s conservatives) for winning the general election in May 2019. That’s because it was billed as the ‘climate election’, which the left was supposed to win.

As I wrote at the time, in Australia – as in the U.S. and the UK – the left thinks global warming is an election-winning issue. But the voters just aren’t interested.
Everyone — encouraged by Australia’s left-leaning print media and rabidly left-wing state broadcaster ABC — was convinced that this was the election that was going to be won on climate change. Greenpeace actually billed it as a “climate election”. Australia’s Labor party, campaigning on a strongly anti-climate change agenda, was going to oust the incumbent Liberal (i.e. conservative) government because public concern about the environment was so overwhelmingly strong.
Didn’t happen though, did it? Instead, the Liberals won.
Now all the losing losers who lost in Australia are taking their revenge by demanding the resignation of Scott Morrison (aka ScoMo), supposedly because of his mishandling of the fires. They couldn’t beat him by fair means so now they’re trying to do it by foul means.

#SackScoMo. Excuse me? Sack the PM? For what exactly? This is so pathetic, ridiculous and childish. The PM does not deserve to be sacked at all. If anything, this is just another virtue signalling useless & brainless protest. #auspol.

33,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Prince Harry and Princess Meghan astounded the world — and the Royal family, apparently — when they announced they were giving up on their senior royal duties and decamping to Canada. In fact, Meghan has gone already — appearing to leave Harry to pick up the pieces at home.
And it’s a shame, because the UK really did seem ready to embrace its new American princess when the pair tied the knot in a fairytale wedding at Windsor in 2018. Furthermore, the British people really do support the monarchy and do tend to cut them a lot of slack. So what could possibly have gone wrong?


–All those flights–
So, it turns out that British people really aren’t that fond of hypocrisy. And one of the most obvious forms of the art this century has come from the media class, lecturing the ordinary folk on not taking flights while on jet aircraft themselves.
Meghan — and by extension, Harry— has turned out to be an absolute master of the genre. Flying to Africa to hector the rest on climate change was a highlight — working to save the world, one private jet at a time. 

The fact is, being a Royal is a pretty globetrotting job and folk accept that — the British monarchy is also the monarchy for 15 other Commonwealth Realms worldwide including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea. Far from hating on the Queen for the flights she makes, Britons really love the modest way she also travels by train a lot, in preference to the private motorcade or helicopter, without feeling the need to lecture everyone about it.
Indeed, the Queen often skips the more expensive Royal Train altogether these days, and is sometimes seen travelling on ordinary public commuter trains, going with only a single aide to carry her bags. Well, she is 93, after all.

–Because stoicism is for other people–
The famous British stiff upper lip has taken a mighty beating in the modern era — amid the army recruiting millennial snowflakes and young men being encouraged to talk about their feelings rather than learning to regulate them like sane, well-adjusted people. It is small wonder there’s any sangfroid left to shore up a civilised society at all.
But even so, perhaps the United Kingdom’s much-reduced sense of reserve is not easy to acclimatise to if coming from the emotions-trump-facts luvvie world of Hollywood. Nobody expected Meghan Markle to break with Royal protocol in a television interview with British network ITV in 2019 to talk about how hard her life was — not least the interviewer, who appeared genuinely amazed to have his questions answered.

Describing marrying into one of the wealthiest, powerful, and respected families on the planet, former U.S. television actress Meghan told the documentary her life was “hard” and a “struggle”.

34,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Prince Charles has a “genuine fear” that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s split from the Royal Family will deepen and become permanent, royal sources have said.
Sources told The Mirror: “There’s a genuine fear from Charles that this could be the beginning of the end for Harry and Meghan’s involvement with the family and that, in his words would be ‘an utter tragedy’.


“Charles has implored everyone to work together to bring them back into the fold before it is too late, as he realises the benefits they have as a couple and indeed for the popularity of the monarchy across the world.
“The message is clear: the stakes are too high to lose one of the family’s greatest assets.”
The source continued that while Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Wales have discussed a more slim-lined monarchy, plans were for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William and Kate, to take on the more formal duties while the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan, were to have been allowed to “spread their wings and have a far more fluid role”.

However, Prince Harry was said to have found processes at Buckingham Palace moving too slowly, resulting in him and his wife making the bombshell announcement on Wednesday that they were to be stepping back as “senior” members of The Firm to carve out “progressive” new lives for themselves.
The statement, reportedly published without the foreknowledge of the Queen or the other members of the Windsor family, published on Instagram set out ambitious plans with the couple setting out what appears to be a half-in-half-out royal life.

It will be the first time that the four will have met together to discuss the crisis at the heart of the Royal Family.


Meghan the Duchess of Sussex, who returned to Canada 24 hours after she and Harry dropped the bombshell that they would be stepping back as “senior” royals, is expected to be joining the conference by telephone.
On Wednesday, the Sussexes announced in a statement made on Instagram that they would be seeking “progressive” new lives, become “financially independent”, and would be splitting their time between North America and the United Kingdom.
Buckingham Palace, Clarence House, and Kensington Palace have been under pressure to come up with a workable solution to the couple’s demands, with a source telling ITV that Monday’s meeting would address “the thinking the Sussexes outlined” and review the “range of possibilities”.

Problems may arise over the ‘hybrid royalty’ model the Sussexes proposed versus the reality of senior members of the Royal Family eschewing commercial endeavours whilst in service to the Crown. There is also the question of funding, the use of Crown residences, and security.
“Making a change to the working life and role in the Monarchy for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex requires complex and thoughtful discussion,” a Buckingham Palace source said.

36,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Hong Kong (AFP) – Human Rights Watch chief Kenneth Roth said Sunday he had been denied entry into Hong Kong, where he had arrived to launch the watchdog’s annual report after months of civil unrest in the city.
“I had hoped to spotlight Beijing’s deepening assault on international efforts to uphold human rights,” Roth said. “The refusal to let me enter Hong Kong vividly illustrates the problem.”


The long-time executive director of the New York-based rights group said in a video posted to Twitter that he was turned back by authorities at the financial hub’s airport.

China last month announced sanctions on American NGOs, including HRW, in retaliation for the passage of a US bill backing pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. 
“A large amount of facts and evidence… make it clear that these non-governmental organisations support anti-China” forces and “incite separatist activities for Hong Kong independence”, China’s foreign affairs ministry spokesman Hua Chunying said at the time.
Roth joins a growing list of openly critical academics, researchers, politicians and activists who have been denied entry in recent years.

37,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"WASHINGTON, DC — American and Taiwanese officials celebrated President Tsai Ing-wen’s reelection on Saturday, in what is widely considered a rebuke to China.
Tsai won in a landslide victory over pro-Beijing candidate Han Kuo-yu, the mayor of Kaohsiung, the second largest city in Taiwan.


“The people in Taiwan proved that democracy works,” said Ambassador Stanley Kao, Taiwan’s top representative in Washington, D.C., at an event marking the election.
James F. Moriarty, the top American diplomat in Taiwan, was also at the event to celebrate the occasion. “It’s a great morning for Taiwan and for all people who believe they should decide their own futures,” he said. “In 2020 we will work closely together to advance our shared interests and values.”
Randy Schriver, until recently the assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, echoed his remarks. “This is in fact a great day for all the people of Taiwan,” said Shriver, chairman and founder of Project 2049.

“Its democracy is such a key part of why Taiwan is internationally admired,” he added. “There will be many people in China wondering ‘why can’t we go to the polls.'”
Since Tsai’s election in 2016, China has ramped up diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan in an effort to isolate the self-governing island. China considers Taiwan a breakaway province, while Taiwan maintains it is a separate nation and the only Chinese-speaking democracy.
The U.S. switched its diplomatic ties from Taiwan to China in 1979 but maintains robust informal diplomatic relations with Taiwan and a duty to help Taiwan defend itself against China. China’s current president has pledged to reunite the two by 2049, including by force.
Tsai’s party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) favors the status quo between China and Taiwan, while Han’s party, the Kuomingtang (KMT), favors closer relations with Beijing.
Tsai’s victory had been far from certain. But after mass protests broke out last summer in Hong Kong against what protesters saw as Beijing’s increasing violations of Hong Kong’s autonomy under the “one country, two systems” policy, support for Tsai swelled.

Han “never recovered from the political impact of the protests in Hong Kong,” said Derek Mitchell, president of the National Democratic Institute, during a panel discussion at the event.
Noting Beijing’s efforts to spread disinformation ahead of the elections, the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Bonnie Glaser said Beijing “has not succeeded in bullying and intimidating Taiwan.”

Jonathan Fritz, deputy assistant secretary of state for China, Mongolia, and Taiwan Coordination, said the U.S. would work to further strengthen the informal U.S.-Taiwanese relationship and “to counter the unilateral efforts to change the status quo.”
Walter Lohman, director of the Asian Studies Center at the Heritage Foundation, called for closer ties between the U.S. and Taiwan, including a free trade agreement. “The timing is right on the U.S. side,” he said.
In Taiwan, Tsai delivered a rousing victory speech that paid tribute to the “courage and persistence” of Taiwan.

“This evening belongs to all the people of Taiwan,” she said. “Together we have held on to this land of freedom. Together we have held on to this stronghold of democracy.”
“This is the prize of democracy, this is the weight of democracy, this is the taste of freedom,” she said.
In a reference to Beijing, she said that she believed the “other side of the Taiwan Strait has heard us,” and called upon its leadership for dialogue.
She called for all political parties in Taiwan to “unite and work together.”
“Once again, today we hold on to freedom and democracy, tomorrow let us work together to overcome all sorts of challenges thrown at us,” she said.
Russell Hsiao, executive director of Global Taiwan Institute, which co-hosted Saturday’s event, said, “This is indeed a remarkable demonstration of democracy in action.”
“Not all countries take the risk of letting their average citizens elect leaders,” the Brookings Institution’s Richard Bush said during a panel discussion at the event. “Taiwan has been willing to take that risk for over 20 years.”

38,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Beijing (AFP) – China on Sunday slammed officials from the US and other countries for congratulating Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen after she was re-elected with a landslide victory in a stunning rebuke of Beijing’s campaign to isolate the self-ruled island.
Tsai, who had pitched herself as a defender of liberal democratic values against an increasingly authoritarian China, secured a record-breaking win in Saturday’s presidential election.


US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as well as top diplomats from Britain and Japan, issued statements congratulating Tsai and the island’s democratic elections.
But Beijing, which views Taiwan as part of its territory, denounced their actions as violating the one-China principle.
“The Chinese side expresses strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to this,” said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang.

“We oppose any form of official exchange between Taiwan and countries that have established diplomatic relations with China,” he said in a statement.
Chinese state media also sought to downplay Tsai’s victory and cast doubt on the legitimacy of her campaign by accusing the Taiwanese leader of “dirty tactics” and cheating.
Tsai and her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) used “dirty tactics such as cheating, repression and intimidation to get votes, fully exposing their selfish, greedy and evil nature”, said official news agency Xinhua in an op-ed Sunday.
Xinhua also accused Tsai of buying votes, and said “external dark forces” were partly responsible for the election results.
Beijing, which has vowed to one day take Taiwan — by force if necessary — loathes Tsai because she refuses to acknowledge the idea that Taiwan is part of “one China”.

China doubled down on its “one-China principle” after Tsai’s victory, with Geng emphasising Sunday that “regardless of what happens in Taiwan, the basic facts won’t change: there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China”.
“The Chinese government’s position won’t change,” he added in a statement.

-‘Orchestrating tensions’-
Over the last four years, Beijing has ramped up economic, military and diplomatic pressure on the island, hoping it would scare voters into supporting Tsai’s opposition.
But the strong-arm tactics have backfired and voters flocked to Tsai’s DPP, fuelled in part by China’s hardline response to months of huge and violent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.

Chinese state media have accused Tsai, who frequently invokes Hong Kong’s protests as a warning about a Beijing-controlled Taiwan, of fear-mongering.
Tsai and her party are “orchestrating tensions”, wrote the nationalistic Global Times on Saturday.
At the end of 2019, the Taiwanese leader “wantonly hyped up the so-called threat from the Chinese mainland while slandering Han Kuo-yu’s mainland connections”, it said, referring to her Beijing-friendly main opponent from the Kuomintang party.
Chinese state media also dismissed Saturday’s election results as an anomaly in long-term ties between Taiwan and the mainland, with Xinhua describing Tsai’s win as a “fluke”.
“The fact that the Chinese mainland is getting increasingly stronger and the Taiwan island is getting weaker is an inevitable reality,” added the Global Times.
“Recognising and complying with the reality is the only feasible option for Taiwan’s peaceful development.”"

“I am hopeful that we can reach an agreement on how to proceed with the trial that will allow the opportunity for both the House and the president’s counsel if they choose to do so,” Collins said, according to Bangor Daily News.

While Collins did not indicate how many GOP senators comprised her group, she stressed that lawmakers should be “completely open to calling witnesses.”
Collins, along with Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), solidified Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-KY) upper hand in the Senate after agreeing that the Senate should follow the precedent of former President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial and make a decision on witnesses after opening arguments, rather than reaching a pre-trial agreement, which Democrats pushed.
“The process moved to a period during which the Senate debated and voted that three witnesses should be deposed. I believe that this process — the Clinton approach — worked well,” Collins told reporters, according to the Hill.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is expected to transmit the articles of impeachment to the upper chamber this coming week.
“I have asked Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to be prepared to bring to the Floor next week a resolution to appoint managers and transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate,” Pelosi wrote in a letter to colleagues.
“I will be consulting with you at our Tuesday House Democratic Caucus meeting,” she added."
40,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"On Friday’s “McLaughlin Group,” Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page stated that the enthusiasm for former National Security Adviser John Bolton’s testimony before the Senate’s impeachment trial has faded and people are already “looking ahead to Iowa and the primaries.”
Page said, “I’ve seen enthusiasm for hearing Bolton’s testimony kind of fade as days go by. Because — and this is kind of a repeat of what we’ve seen before, with the Mueller report, and other investigations that have gone on, that they haven’t resulted in that big jackpot that one side or the other was hoping for. And so, now people are really looking ahead to Iowa and the primaries.”

41,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Months before a whistleblower complaint that would spark the Democrat effort for impeachment, a shadowy liberal group founded and staffed by Obama administration alums and former Democrat congressional staffers launched an outside investigation into whether President Trump’s allies were seeking “foreign interference” from Ukraine in the 2020 elections.
The group, American Oversight, began investigating the issue in May — more than two months before the “whistleblower” filed a complaint alleging Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country to investigate one of the President’s main domestic political rivals.”


The group’s purpose is to file Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuits requesting official documents from the administration that could be used to bolster Democrat congressional investigations, and its actions on Ukraine show Congress began looking for Ukraine-related dirt on the administration before the “whistleblower” filed his complaint that catalyzed impeachment.
American Oversight claims to be the top “Freedom of Information Act litigator investigating the Trump administration.”
In anticipation of Democrats winning back the House in 2018, it launched a “Parallel Investigations Initiative” in April to reinforce congressional investigations of the Trump administration. It said in a statement:

Today, American Oversight announces the Parallel Investigations Initiative to lay the groundwork for this potential surge in congressional oversight activity. We have begun proactively tracking oversight requests made by both the chairs and ranking members of key congressional committees and, in many cases, we’ve already submitted parallel FOIA requests for the same information.
…
The Trump administration won’t know what hit them. Independent FOIA litigation paired with aggressive congressional oversight creates a nightmare for federal agencies because of the different levers litigants and members of Congress can pull to enforce their demands.
The group was founded in March 2017 by Austin Evers, a former senior counsel during the Obama State Department, to counter the Trump administration using FOIA. Evers said in a June 2018 interview:
I was quite troubled by the election of Donald Trump and his posture toward towards public service as a private enterprise, and I was also concerned that there didn’t seem to be any transparency watchdogs that planned to be antagonistic toward the administration. We had faced such high profile and aggressive litigation during the last administration that I wanted to model to make sure that this administration was held accountable.
The group claims to be non-partisan, but most of its staff have worked for Democrat administrations, lawmakers, or groups. The group’s senior adviser, Melanie Sloan, is a former federal prosecutor and Capitol Hill staffer who worked for now Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and then Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE). She founded the left-wing watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (CREW) and ran it for more than a decade.
The group has kept its funding completely hidden. Sloan said in an interview with USA Today that the group is organized as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and does not plan to disclose its funding sources. “We don’t discuss our donors,” she said.
Conservative watchdog Influence Watch has noted the group was founded after liberal “mega-donors” met at a posh Florida retreat in January 2017 to discuss ways to defeat the Trump administration, including through litigation. The retreat was hosted by David Brock, a former conservative journalist who founded the Democrat-affiliated publisher Media Matters, according to the Washington Free Beacon. Brock has close ties with Sloan, serving on CREW’s board before taking control from 2014 through late 2016.
One of American Oversight’s donors is the progressive Schooner Foundation, which gave $100,000 to the group in 2017, according to Influence Watch. Its founder is Vin Ryan, a multimillionaire and one of the top 50 richest people in Massachusetts.

It is not public how closely the group works with congressional Democrats, but House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff’s (D-CA) final impeachment inquiry report directly referenced the group’s work five separate times.
And American Oversight is still receiving documents related to the impeachment inquiry. The most recent batch of emails obtained by the group in late December were from the Pentagon. A recent CNN report highlighted emails obtained from American Oversight and The Center for Public Integrity (CPI).

Schumer shortly after cited one of the Pentagon emails obtained by CPI in a recent press conference as justification for calling in its author to testify, according to CNN:
If there was ever an argument that we need [Office of Management and Budget official Michael Duffey], to come testify, this is that information. This email is explosive. A top administration official, one that we requested, is saying, stop the aid 90 minutes after Trump called Zelensky and said keep it hush, hush. What more do you need to request a witness?
In March, as part of a different congressional investigation on retaliation against civil servants, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY) and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Bob Menendez (D-NJ) cited American Oversight in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Except for the mention in the CNN piece, the group’s work on the Ukraine issue has gone on relatively quietly since May — months before the “whistleblower” filed his complaint on August 12, 2019.

American Oversight filed a FOIA request on May 21, 2019, for documents from the State Department related to the firing of then U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and on whether the president’s personal attorney was trying to “persuade the Ukrainian government to conduct an investigation connected to a potential political opponent of the president.”
On that same day, 13 House Democrats announced their support for an impeachment inquiry — the largest group of Democrats to do so at that time. The group included Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and a former State Department official.
By that time, Democrats had already been eyeing the administration’s moves on Ukraine.
On March 20, the Hill‘s John Solomon reported Ukraine’s top prosecutor was opening an investigation into whether Ukraine’s law enforcement apparatus leaked financial records during the 2016 election on then Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to help Hillary Clinton’s campaign.
The Hill article said Yovanovitch gave the top prosecutor a list of defendants who he would not be allowed to pursue and refused to cooperate in an early investigation into the alleged misappropriation of U.S. aid in Ukraine. The article also alleged that Yovanovitch had repeatedly bad-mouthed Trump in private.
The article caused consternation for Yovanovitch and her allies in the U.S. government, as a handful of bureaucrats would later testify to the House. After the article, more Trump allies called for Yovanovitch’s firing. On March 24, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted that Yovanovitch was a “joker.”

We need more ⁦@RichardGrenell’s and less of these jokers as ambassadors.

42,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Arkansas State Sen. Missy Irvin (R-AR) joined Breitbart News Saturday, where she discussed her resolution condemning the actions of the House of Representatives over the impeachment “sham” against President Donald Trump and said “the people” are paying the price.
“Hearing from my constituents and the people in the state of Arkansas, who overwhelmingly voted for President Trump, they’re just so frustrated and they’re sick of it,” Irvin told host Matthew Boyle. “Enough is enough. They’re just playing this high stakes game of chicken up there with our Constitution and with our democracy and it’s really undermining the office of the presidency of our country.”


Irvin also called the holding of the articles of impeachment by the United States House of Representatives at a federal level “incredibly ridiculous” and “incredibly reckless.”
Irvin went on to talk about “the people” who are paying the price for the “game” being played by those in Washington, DC, by calling out challenges with insurance premiums and the inability to afford insurance, which cannot be “fixed at a state level.”


“This president’s not really able to work the way he wants to work and needs to work in order to provide that level of consistency, whether it’s healthcare reform, corrections, roads and infrastructure, immigration reform, those kinds of things really affect the state,” Irvin said.
“The people of our state pay the price,” Irvin added. “The normal, every day, Joe blow citizen pays the price for this.”
Irvin also claimed the impeachment dealings are putting “our soldiers abroad” and our nation at risk.
“Other countries see this. They see this undermining of the office of the presidency and the undermining of our government and how it’s functioning and that is putting us on unsteady ground out there.
In a statement released Friday, Irvin condemned some members of the House of Representatives who approved and are holding articles of impeachment against President Trump:
“On behalf of my entire Republican Senate Caucus, I filed this resolution today to encourage the United States Senate to act as quickly as possible within their full constitutional authority regarding the impeachment process and to condemn the actions of some members of the House of Representatives for passing and holding articles of impeachment against President Donald J. Trump.”

47,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"CNN has agreed to shell out $76 million in a back pay case that involved union employees, making it the largest monetary settlement in the history of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).
Variety reported that the labor dispute began in 2003 when the media company fired a group of unionized subcontractors working as technicians and in other support roles for Team Video Services before hiring non-union employees to replace those workers.


The action sparked a litigation war between the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians and Communications Workers of America that has lasted more than a decade.

More than 300 people will take part in the settlement. The NLRB, a federal agency that allows employees to unionize in the workplace, said in a statement that $76 million is more than what the agency typically sees in a back pay enforcement case.
“The settlement demonstrates the Board’s continued commitment to enforcing the law and ensuring employees who were treated unfairly obtain the monetary relief ordered by the Board,” general counsel Peter B. Robb said.
A spokesperson for CNN said in a statement it was “pleased” to have settled the case.
“After more than a decade of litigation, negotiation and appeals we are pleased to have resolved a longstanding legal matter,” a CNN representative said."
48,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Kandahar (Afghanistan) (AFP) – Two American soldiers were killed in southern Afghanistan on Saturday when a Taliban roadside bomb ripped through an army vehicle, officials said.
Two other soldiers were wounded in the attack in Kandahar province, according to NATO’s Resolute Support mission in the country.


A mission spokesman said the names of those killed were being withheld pending notification of next of kin.
The troops were on patrol near Kandahar airport in Dand district, provincial police spokesman Jamal Nasir Barkzai told AFP.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, with spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid saying on Twitter that the blast destroyed the vehicle and killed all on board.

Violence in Afghanistan usually recedes as winter sets in. But this year the Taliban have pushed forward with their operations despite heavy snowfall in the mountains — and despite their negotiations with the US for a deal that would see American troops leave the country.
According to details made public so far, the Pentagon would withdraw about 5,000 of its 13,000 or so troops from five bases across Afghanistan, provided the Taliban sticks to its security pledges.
The insurgents have said they will renounce Al-Qaeda, fight the Islamic State group and stop jihadists using Afghanistan as a safe haven.
Last year was the deadliest for US forces in Afghanistan since combat operations officially finished at the end of 2014, highlighting the challenging security situation that persists.
More than 2,400 US troops have been killed in combat there since the US-led invasion in October 2001."

53,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"A dishonorably discharged Marine allegedly impersonated a security guard for President Donald Trump’s Marine One helicopter and bypassed checkpoints at Palm Beach International Airport last week, according to a report.
The New York Times said:



The former Marine, Brandon M. Magnan, 37, of Naples, Fla., was charged on Jan. 6 with false personation of officer or employee of the United States, according to a criminal complaint by the United States Secret Service.
It wasn’t clear why Mr. Magnan was trying to get near the helicopter. Marine One, which is piloted and protected by the Marine Corps unit known as HMX-1, is used to transport the president for shorter trips, the Secret Service said.
Mr. Trump was spending his winter vacation in Palm Beach, Fla., at his private Mar-a-Lago resort at the time of the episode with Mr. Magnan.

Law enforcement said Magnan was asked to present his credentials upon entering Atlantic Aviation without Marine attire, often worn by the president’s security team during presidential travel, according to court documents.

The Palm Beach Post first reported that a deputy asked a colleague to verify Magnan’s credentials, which were later found to be falsified. The suspect retorted that he was a retired Marine. However, the FBI’s crime database reportedly shows Magnan was dishonorably discharged after he was court-martialed for “serious offenses.” He was convicted of “abusive sexual conduct” and is a registered sex offender.
Magnan is charged with false presentation of an officer or employee of the U.S. He faces up to three years in jail and a $250,000 fine. The former military member has been out on bond as of Monday and is scheduled to appear in a Florida court on January 27th."
54,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Anti-Israel professors overwhelmingly stack their Israel-Palestine courses with pro-BDS content, according to a recent study, which noted that its results strongly suggest that academic BDS-supporting professors “are using their Israel-related courses to promote a politically motivated, anti-Israel perspective” in compliance with “guidelines calling on faculty to work against ‘the normalization of Israel in the global academy.'”
Professors in support of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement are stacking their courses with material by pro-BDS authors, according to a study by the non-profit anti-Semitism watchdog group, AMCHA Initiative.


BDS is a movement which seeks to systematically destroy the world’s only Jewish state through financial means, by boycotting companies that do business with Israel.
According to AMCHA,  BDS-supporting professors include an average of 78 percent of readings authored by BDS supporters in their courses.
“All of the academic BDS-supporting instructors had a majority of their readings authored by BDS supporters, whereas only 2 of the 35 syllabi of non-BDS-supporting instructors had a majority of their course readings authored by BDS supporters, and none more than 60%,” noted the study.

“These results strongly suggest that faculty who support an academic boycott of Israel engage in politically-motivated efforts to implement the anti-normalization component of the boycott in their classrooms, by exposing students to an overwhelming preponderance of authors and readings likely to portray Israel as an illegitimate country unworthy of normalization,” the report added.
AMCHA’s research methods included a review of 50 syllabi from courses “focusing primarily on the contemporary Palestinian-Israeli or Arab-Israeli conflict,” and spanning from Fall 2008 to Spring 2019 semesters.
“In order to isolate the impact on course readings of support for academic BDS and its explicit call for the anti-normalization of Israel in the academy, syllabi were only included in the study if the course instructors were determined to support an academic boycott of Israel, or determined to not support either an academic boycott of Israel or BDS more generally,” said AMCHA.
The study added that 48 of the 50 syllabi were from courses taught by tenure-track faculty or visiting professors.
“There was a very large, highly significant difference between the average percentages of BDS-authored readings in the syllabi of instructors who support the academic boycott of Israel (median 78%), and those who do not support any form of BDS (median 17%),” noted the study of its results.

The study continued:
In addition, the two groups of instructors showed almost no overlap in the distribution of percentages of course readings with BDS-supporting authors: 13 of the 15 syllabi of academic boycott supporting instructors had at least two-thirds of their readings authored by BDS-supporters, whereas only 2 of the 35 syllabi of non-BDS-supporting instructors had more than half of their readings authored by BDS-supporters and none of them with more than 60% of readings authored by BDS-supporters.
The stark difference between the average percentage of course readings with pro-BDS authors in the syllabi of academic BDS-supporting instructors (78%) and in the syllabi of instructors who had not expressed public support for any kind of BDS (17%), with almost no overlap between these two groups, leaves little doubt that instructors who support academic BDS make a calculated choice to heavily weight their course materials with readings authored by BDS supporters.
“This, in turn, strongly suggests that academic BDS-supporting instructors are using their Israel-related courses to promote a politically motivated, anti-Israel perspective that is compliant with the PACBI/USACBI guidelines calling on faculty to work against ‘the normalization of Israel in the global academy,'” added AMCHA.
Given the results of the study, AMCHA suggests that universities publicly affirm that pro-BDS activity among their faculty is harmful to the education and opportunities of its students.
“While freedom of speech protects faculty’s right to sign petitions and make extramural statements in support of academic BDS and academic freedom generally protects their right to develop and teach courses as they see fit, it is important to point out the harmful consequences of politically-motivated faculty weaponizing their course curricula to ensure that Israel is not ‘normalized’ in the academy,” said AMCHA.
“Faculty should be urged by university administrators to establish their own safeguards against the politicization of the academy,” the organization added.
It is apparent that anti-Israel bias is growing on college campuses across the United States via the academic boycott of Israel.
In September 2018, a professor at the University of Michigan refused to write a letter of recommendation to a student that was planning to study abroad in Israel. In November 2018, faculty at Pitzer College voted to suspend its study abroad program in Israel.

55,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Several top officials from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) said that the school made “significant” errors in “judgement” by taking $850,000 in contributions from Jeffrey Epstein, according to an internal review.
MIT asked law firm Goodwin Proctor to conduct an internal review, which was unveiled Friday, to “understand the origins, nature and extent of Jeffrey Epstein’s ties to MIT and learn from them,” President L. Rafael Reif announced in an email to the MIT community.


The report stated that Reif “had little knowledge” of the school’s acceptance of the gifts from Epstein, who was a convicted sex offender.
The findings from Goodwin Proctor’s report also found that the disgraced financier made ten donations to MIT amounting to $850,000 between 2002 and 2017.
Only $100,000 of the money was donated after Epstein’s 2008 conviction.

Professor Seth Lloyd and Media Lab Director Joichi Ito solicited the post-conviction donations, the New York Post reported. Ito resigned after word got out about the MIT donation scandal in August.
MIT’s executive committee explained in a written statement that its members were “disturbed” by Lloyd and Epstein’s interactions and asked Reif to consider “disciplinary measures.”
“The revelations that MIT had a donor relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender, have deeply shaken the MIT community,” the executive committee wrote in its statement reacting to the findings of the report.
The billionaire sex offender also reportedly visited MIT’s campus nine times.
MIT once gave Epstein a grapefruit-sized 3D-printed marble in exchange for his high-dollar contributions.
To save face, MIT said it would donate $850,000 to a charity that supports survivors of sexual abuse.
MIT is not the only university that received scrutiny for accepting money from the convicted pedophile. Harvard University accepted $8.9 million, and Stanford University once accepted a gift of $50,000 from Epstein."

The latest earthquake took place around 9:00 a.m. local time and has caused damage by the island’s southern coast, where hundreds of schools and homes collapsed from the 6.4-magnitude earthquake Tuesday.


The island’s power authority said Saturday’s quake left an estimated 5,000 customers without power.
Witnesses stated that the tremors caused concrete debris from the already-damaged buildings to fall on the streets.

Authorities say at least four people have died as severe storms sweep across parts of the U.S. South, bringing high winds and unrelenting rain.
The Bossier Parish Sheriff’s Office in Louisiana said on Facebook that firefighters found the bodies of an elderly couple Saturday near their demolished trailer. The winds were so strong that the home was moved 200 feet from its foundation. 

The deaths of the victims, who were the in-laws of a parish deputy, brings the storm-related toll in the state to three after a 75-year-old man was killed in Oil City, according to the Caddo Parish Coroner’s Office. Raymond Holden was in bed when the tree fell on his home, crushing him. 
Bossier Parish Sheriff Julian Whittington told The Associated Press that a truck driver and a Benton police officer had a close call after being shocked by a downed power line.
“A power line was hanging across the road and a eighteen wheeler truck ran into it and got hung up in it and the Benton officer got there to help him,” Whittington said. Both were expected to survive.
The National Weather Service in Shreveport estimated that a tornado, with about around 135 mph (xx) winds, touched down in Bossier Parish.
Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas on Saturday morning were clear of the severe thunderstorms that had passed through the night before. One person died Friday night in Texas when a car flipped into a creek in Dallas. Additionally, lightning from Friday’s stormy weather is suspected of causing two house fires in the North Texas cities of Burleson and Mansfield. Officials said no one was injured.

Homes were damaged or destroyed in Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas on Friday, but no injuries were reported. Downed trees and power lines were widespread. 
According to PowerOutage.us, Mississippi had more than 61,0000 power outages midday Saturday. About 35,000 customers were without power in Louisiana. In Tennessee, Memphis Light, Gas and Water said about 23,000 customers were without power Saturday morning. Damage was widespread throughout Shelby County, Tennessee’s most populous county that includes Memphis, including downed trees and power poles, some of which will need to be replaced, according to the utility. 

Entergy Arkansas reported nearly 42,000 power outages Saturday morning, mostly in the southeastern part of the state. Southwestern Electric Power Co. reported nearly 5,000 customers in East Texas were without power Saturday morning.
The Oklahoma Department of Transportation reported Saturday morning that portions of several highways in the southeastern part of the state were closed due to flooding. The Arkansas Department of Transportation reported that portions of several state highways across the state, particularly in the southeastern portion of Arkansas were closed due to downed trees and power lines and to flooding.
On Alabama’s Gulf Coast, Baldwin County canceled school activities including sporting events for Saturday. The National Weather Service warned of high winds and flooding and the potential for 10-foot-high (3-meter-high) waves on beaches, where northern visitors escaping the cold are a common sight during the winter.

Many streams already are at or near flood levels because of earlier storms, and heavy rains could lead to flash flooding across the region, forecasters said. Parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana were under flash flood warnings or watches on Saturday. 
The storm, bringing the threat of ice and snow to the Chicago area, prompted the cancellation of about 1,000 flights Saturday at Chicago’s two main airports.
The Chicago Department of Aviation’s online flight-tracking website showed that as of 10:30 a.m. Saturday about 950 flight cancellations were reported at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and more than 50 flights had been canceled at Midway International Airport.
Delays at O’Hare and Midway were averaging around 15 minutes, the department said.
The weather service issued a winter weather advisory, flood watch and lakeshore flood warning for the Chicago metropolitan area for Saturday and a winter storm warning for adjacent areas of northwestern Illinois.
The weather service said rain, possibly mixed with snow, freezing rain and sleet was expected through Saturday afternoon in the Chicago area before changing by evening over to snow and sleet, possibly mixed with freezing rain.
Breezy conditions were forecast with gusts as high as 45 mph (72 kph).

58,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Removing American forces from Iraq would likely damage Tehran’s interests, assessed Lee Smith, author of The Plot Against the President: The True Story of How Congressman Devin Nunes Uncovered the Biggest Political Scandal in U.S. History, in a Thursday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host John Hayward.
The killing of Qasem Soleimani, Smith argued, offered the United States an opportunity to extricate itself from Iraq while demonstrating America’s capacity to project military power in Iraq from outside the state’s territory.


Smith said, “We’ve reached the end of the road [in Iraq]. There’s not much left to do. President Trump has been pretty clear about this, saying we defeated ISIS. That was the main reason that President Obama redeployed troops in Iraq in 2014. When there are actions taken that affect the United States, we’ve shown that we don’t need to be there to do something about it. The drone that killed Soleimani was dispatched from Qatar.”
LISTEN:


Smith added, “It’s an enormous win for President Trump. It’s a huge strategic victory. For the first time in 40 years, an American president made the Iranians responsible for the terror proxies they fund to kill in their name. It’s really a big deal. It’s an opportune moment for a number of different reasons to use this as a platform to leave Iraq once and for all.”
A continued American presence in Iraq leaves U.S. forces more vulnerable to Iranian attacks, explained Smith.
Smith said, “The United States has been bizarrely carrying a very heavy burden, which, ultimately is on behalf of the Iranians. So it’s not clear to me the Iranians will be happy if we go. One of the main reasons they’ve been firing at U.S. troops and targeting American facilities — it’s not to make us go — they’re negotiating the Iran deal. They want money. They want Trump to relieve sanctions. President Trump has reimposed sanctions on the Iranians, that’s why they’re targeting American troops, American allies, and American facilities, not to make us go. They’re negotiating to get us to relieve sanctions. They want the money.”
Mansour said, “It’s an amazingly stupid way to do it, by the way.”
Smith concurred, “You and I agree on that. President Donald Trump agrees, it’s a really stupid thing. You know who doesn’t agree? Forty years of American policy makers who thought that made sense. That’s what the Iran deal is all about. It’s an enormous bribe, right? To keep a bad group of actors from firing on us. So everyone has thought that that’s a reasonable thing to do, to pay the Iranians to not shoot at us. We agree it’s dumb. Thank goodness Donald Trump thinks it’s dumb, too, and he stopped paying them.”
Smith continued, “President Obama did it. President Bush did it. President Clinton did it. This goes back to President Carter. It’s six administrations of people paying off these thugs.”

59,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran announced Saturday that its military ‘unintentionally’ shot down a Ukrainian jetliner, killing all 176 aboard.
The statement came Saturday morning and blamed “human error” for the shootdown.


The jetliner, a Boeing 737 operated by Ukrainian International Airlines, went down on the outskirts of Tehran during takeoff just hours after Iran launched a barrage of missiles at U.S. forces.

Iran had denied for several days that a missile downed the aircraft. But then the U.S. and Canada, citing intelligence, said they believe Iran shot down the aircraft.
The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, at least 63 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians, according to officials.
From Breitbart News: 
Foreign Minister of Islamic Republic of Iran Tweeted:
 

A sad day. Preliminary conclusions of internal investigation by Armed Forces: 
Human error at time of crisis caused by US adventurism led to disaster
Our profound regrets, apologies and condolences to our people, to the families of all victims, and to other affected nations.💔

60,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"The fake news media are blaming President Trump for a Ukrainian passenger plane that was probably shot down by the terrorist state of Iran.
This is what you call trolling.


The media do not actually believe Trump is to blame.
Hell, the media don’t even know for sure yet how or why the plane went down.
None of that matters, though, because the media are no longer a news gathering institution. Rather, they are a trolling operation huddled in record numbers in the Deep Blue Bubbles of Manhattan and Washington, DC, where they spend billions of corporate dollars scheming to troll Trump.

We’ll start with the far-left Atlantic, by way of David Frump, a card-carrying member of Conservative Incorporated’s Never Trump Tribe. (Sorry, I don’t reward trolling with links.):
No American paid a price for President Donald Trump’s decision to kill Iran’s Qasem Soleimani. But it looks like 176 other people did, including 63 Canadian citizens and many more Iranian nationals en route to Canada.
Frum is also angry Trump targeted Iran’s terror mastermind, Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani:
The Trump administration is telling an obviously false story about the decision to kill Soleimani. Instead of acknowledging that Soleimani was killed in reprisal, the Trump administration instead argues that the killing was necessary to avert attacks[.]
This, coming from the same guy who backed a pre-emptive war against Saddam Hussein, is rich enough, but he’s so desperate to blister Trump, Frum would rather look like an idiot than not. Soleimani has literally spent decades plotting to kill Americans. Decades. That means taking him out was a way to “avert attacks” against Americans period, whether those attacks were imminent or not.
Here’s the far-left Associated Press:
As Iran and US take step back from the brink, Canada grieves
…
[W]hat had begun with a drone attack on Gen. Qassem Soleimani’s motorcade at the Baghdad airport had suddenly rippled outward until dozens of Iranian-Canadians, dozens of Iranian students studying in Canada, were dead.
To begin with, this is all guesswork. No one knows why Iran shot down the plane. It might have been a mistake as opposed to retaliation. After all, there were Iranians on board.

Nevertheless, it doesn’t matter why, at least within the context of Trump. America didn’t shoot the plane down; a terrorist nation did. All America did was look to protect itself from this terrorist nation after this terrorist nation killed an American contractor (a Muslim-American immigrant, I should add) and attacked our embassy in Iraq, which is an act of war.
For years, Iran has been escalating, escalating, escalating and Trump has stayed cool — at least until he could not stay cool anymore with the death of an American citizen and attack on our sovereign soil.

What would Frum and his media confederates have us do? Nothing?
Trump’s restraint in the face of these outrageous provocations has been remarkable, and his decision to target the serial mass murderer Soleimani is not only just; it is strategically brilliant. On top of stripping Iran of its most effective terror strategist, every Iranian official is now terrified the next drone will knock next on their door.
Trump hit these monsters right where it hurts: personally. Does anyone doubt Iran’s decision to lob a few ineffective missiles on Wednesday and then run off the battlefield like scared little girls wasn’t motivated by self-interest, out of the fear any one of them could be next for a drone strike?

As you will see below, the agreed-upon word to blame Trump is “crossfire,” which, as I’ll explain below, is a flat-out lie.
Deep State sycophant Anne Applebaum:

The Tehran plane crash is a terrible, sickening twist of fate: Ukraine once again sucked in to a geopolitical conflict created by others, along with Ukrainian, Canadian and other passengers caught – like the MH17 passengers –  in the crossfire

61,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview Thursday that Democrats have displayed a hypocritical view of President Donald Trump’s foreign policy regarding Iran.
Sen. Braun spoke to Breitbart News after a contentious classified briefing on the Trump administration’s strike against Iranian top military commander Qasem Soleimani.


The Hoosier senator said Democrats would have criticized Trump for not attacking the Iranian commander in the face of a reportedly imminent threat or for attacking him without authorization from Congress.
Sen. Braun said, “I didn’t get the chance to ask the question, mostly aimed at the Democrats, ‘What would your response be if that had occurred [an imminent strike on Americans] and you had not taken him out and a lot of lives were lost?’ I’m guessing that they would have been angry at Trump because he didn’t do what they were saying. … So I think there’s a lot of hypocrisy there.”
The Indiana conservative said that Congress has “ceded” most of its authority to declare war to the presidency and that Congress should revisit that conversation but not in the context of Sen. Tim Kaine’s (D-VA) War Powers Act resolution.

“I think right now, there is some confusion, and we have purposefully created that by ceding that authority increasingly to presidents and not making an issue of it,” the senator said. 
Braun said the American military could also respond to Iranian aggression while at the same time moving towards withdrawing troops from the Middle East, contending that modern technology does not require a substantial troop presence in the region. He explained with our American military “comparative advantage” we can respond to future aggression.
“We have way too many troops spread across the world,” he added.
 “In general, we need to shrink our longterm presence. we never win these wars in the long run,” Braun said.

70,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The EU reiterated its support for the nuclear deal brokered with Iran, also expressing concerns Friday that the escalating tensions in the region could lead to a resurgence of the Islamic State’s activities.
The EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell called the urgent meeting of European foreign affairs ministers in Brussels after the U.S. killing of Iranian general, Qassem Soleimani, in a drone attack in Iraq on Jan. 3 .


Tehran responded earlier this week with missile strikes at U.S. bases and announced it would no longer respect limits set under the 2015 nuclear deal on how many centrifuges it can use to enrich uranium, fuelling fears Iran could quickly start building a nuclear arsenal.
“We need to understand that the fight against Daesh is not over,” said NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, who attended the meeting in the EU capital and referred to an alternative name for the Islamic State group.
“We have made enormous progress but Daesh can return.”

In an attempt to avoid an escalation between Iran and the United States, EU leaders have intensified diplomatic activities, trying to keep alive the nuclear deal while making sure the U.S.-led anti-IS coalition continues to operate in Iraq. In the wake of the killing of Soleimani, Iraq’s parliament called for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the country.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas reiterated Germany’s position that the fight against IS in Iraq needs to continue.
“I can’t rule out that, if the anti-IS coalition leaves Iraq then IS will regenerate so much that it can carry out attacks in Europe again,” said Maas, speaking to German broadcaster n-tv.
And Denmark;s foreign affairs minister, Jeppe Kofod, said IS is the threat for Europe.”
Despite calls from U.S. President Donald Trump to break away from the nuclear deal, the European Union remains committed to the treaty.

“Thanks to this deal Iran is not a nuclear power,” Borrell said.
Iran struck the deal in 2015 with the United States, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia and China. It has, however, been damaged by Trump’s decision to unilaterally abandon it in 2018 and to impose sanctions that have hurt Iran’s economy.

Iran has gradually rolled back its commitment to the accord and the recent escalation of tensions between Iran and the U.S. has dealt further blows to the pact.
“We are of the opinion that this agreement makes sense because it holds Iran to not developing nuclear weapons, and so we want this agreement to have a future,” Maas said upon arrival at the meeting. “But of course it only has a future if it is complied with, and we expect that from Iran.”
Despite its decision to get rid of restrictions in relation to its enrichment capacity, Iran has not stopped collaborating with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and has made clear it is ready to return to its commitments if sanctions are lifted.

Delivering the meeting’s conclusions, Borrell urged Iran to get back “to full compliance without delay” to make sure the deal can be salvaged.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian continued to insist the accord “is not dead” and said Iran could get access to atomic weapons within “one or two years” if the deal continues to lose its substance.
In a phone call with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson also reaffirmed his support for the deal.
Borrell has invited Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to Brussels for talks, but a date for his visit has yet to be set.
In front of Ghassam Salamé, the head of the UN Support Mission in Libya, the Council also addressed the current crisis in the war-torn country, with Borrell warning of an increased risk of terror activities if a cease-fire is not quickly reached.
Libya is currently governed by duelling authorities, in the east and the west, each relying on different militias. The east-based government is backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, as well as France and Russia. The western, Tripoli-based government receives aid from Turkey, Qatar and Italy.
Borrell said the presence of fighters coming from Syria and Sudan has been detected in Libya recently and insisted the conflict could lead to a new influx of refugees in Europe.
“This crisis may spiral out of control,” Borrell said."
71,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) is co-sponsoring Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) legislation to freeze funding in order to halt further unilateral military action in Iran, the lawmakers confirmed on Saturday.
“As United States Senators, we often disagree on many issues. But standing up for the Constitution is not about partisanship,” the two lawmakers said in a statement to CNN.


“The Founding Fathers were absolutely clear. They wanted to ensure that our country avoided needless conflict and they understood that presidential war-making would be harmful to our democracy,” they added
Sanders introduced the bill after President Donald Trump’s decision to eliminate Iran’s top terror general, Qasem Soleimani, who was responsible for the death of hundreds of Americans and approved of the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. According to the Pentagon, the terrorist general was actively planning more attacks throughout the region with the explicit intention of harming U.S. service members and diplomats.
As Breitbart News reported:
The Pentagon said Soleimani had orchestrated attacks on U.S.-led coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months, including one on December 27 which killed an American contractor and wounded U.S. service members and Iraqi personnel.
However, Lee was disappointed in the Trump administration’s briefing on the attack, calling it “probably the worst briefing I have seen at least on a military issue in the nine years I have served in the United States Senate.”

He continued:
What I found so distressing about that briefing was that one of the messages we received from the briefers was do not debate, do not discuss the issue of the appropriateness of further military intervention against Iran. And that if you do, you’ll be emboldening Iran.
…
The implication being that we would somehow be making America less safe by having a debate or a discussion about the appropriateness of further military involvement against the government of Iran,” he continued. “I find it insulting and demeaning.
Lee clarified to Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that he “supports the legal and moral justification for striking Soleimani and that he believes the worst military briefing was the Barack Obama administration’s briefing on the 2012 Benghazi consulate attack.”
“I want to be very clear, my comments yesterday did not take a position on the appropriateness of the attack that occurred,” he told Breitbart News.
“They were not condemning that; in fact, I acknowledged upfront that I’m willing to concede that they might well have been legally, morally, justifiable and fully constitutional,” he continued:
I mentioned yesterday that it was probably the worst briefing I have ever seen on a military issue. The reason I qualify it that way is that the worst briefing I ever got in that room was on a slightly different issue back in 2012 right after the Benghazi attack, where we were told repeatedly by then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that the attack on the Benghazi consulate was based on a reaction to a video, so, fortunately, this was not that.
“I don’t think they [the Trump officials] were trying to deceive us, but I think some of what they said was emblematic of Congress’s willingness to relinquish its war powers, and that’s an issue,” Lee added, noting that the officials who briefed Congress are “good people.”
“The reason I think we need to do this [War Powers resolution] is consistent with the president’s desire to keep us out of excessive, unnecessary wars,” Lee said, citing the vision of the founding fathers.
The largely symbolic War Powers resolution passed in the House on Thursday."

74,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Former Vice President Joe Biden helped sink the first-ever female nominee for attorney general of the United States in 1993 over the issue of illegal immigration.
Biden, who at the time was the long-serving chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was tasked with presiding over the nomination of Zoë Baird to serve as the nation’s chief law enforcement officer in the weeks leading up to inauguration of President Bill Clinton. The historic nature of the appointment, for if Baird was confirmed she would have been the first-ever female attorney general, appeared to be the perfect chance for Biden to rehabilitate his image after the controversial Clarence Thomas hearings.


The 50-year-old Biden, then in his second decade representing Delaware in the Senate, seemed to relish the opportunity ahead. When Baird’s nomination was announced by Clinton in December 1992, the senator boasted it would take only “about 20 minutes” to round up the votes for confirmation. Biden’s task seemed all the more easy as Baird, a former general counsel to the insurance giant Aetna, was viewed as a safe, if unknown, pick to helm the Department of Justice.
“She looks like an excellent choice,” then-Senate Judiciary ranking member Orrin Hatch (R-UT) told the Hartford Courant. “She’s had some very good private [sector] experience, and from all I know, she’s a very honorable and decent human being.”
The nomination, though, quickly hit a brick wall in January 1993 when it was leaked to the press that Baird and her husband had employed an illegal immigrant couple from Peru to help take care of their son. Baird had initially volunteered the information to the FBI while being vetted for attorney general, resulting in the law enforcement agency launching an inquiry into whether the couple had further violated federal law by not paying social security withholding taxes for the illegal employees.

Clinton, who had yet to be inaugurated president, stood by his nominee, and Biden, at least publicly, signaled that “this is not a deal breaker … that should keep [Baird] from being attorney general.” Privately, however, the senator expressed his resentment to the president-elect and congressional colleagues.

At the center of the matter was not only that Clinton was asking the Senate to confirm someone who had broken the law to serve as the nation’s top law enforcement official, but that Biden, himself, had been put in a similar position as Baird and had opted to “not hire someone who was illegal.” Biden, who was faced with raising two young boys alone after his first wife perished in a tragic car accident only weeks after his election to the Senate, later told Delaware’s News Journal that he confronted Baird on the topic directly.
“I told her … that this was going to be very difficult and it [her situation] bothered me a great deal,” Biden told the paper. “I told her that a lot of middle-class people like myself have had to raise children and been confronted with similar situations.”
“I had an opportunity to do the exact same thing for a lot less money,” he added. “The only person I could find who was an American citizen was for a lot more money. My mother and sister were there to help, but I did not hire someone who was illegal. And there are a lot of people like me.”

Biden’s populist critique of Baird stung all the more because the nominee had already drawn attention for her salary at Aetna, which topped more than $500,000 per year.
Despite the misgivings, Biden was convinced not to postpone Baird’s confirmation by his Democrat colleagues, who were eager to ensure their party’s first incoming president in 12 years did not suffer an early defeat. Baird’s position seemed all the more secure when Hatch agreed with the committee’s senior Democrats, including Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), that the nomination did not warrant delay.

Chances of confirmation only seemed to improve before the start of Baird’s hearings when the nominee and her husband opted to pay a $2,900 fine for employing the illegal immigrants. Upon news of the payment, a spokesman for the president-elect deemed the controversy “now resolved.”
Biden, though, continued to intimate it was anything but finished. One day before the confirmation hearings were scheduled to commence, a letter authored from Ralph Nader and eight other consumer activists to the judiciary committee became public. In the letter, Nader and the others argued for the hearings to be postponed as Baird’s “violations of law need further examination.”
“This illegal conduct may be probative of other instances of bad judgement that need exploration,” the letter read.

Even though Biden would later mock Nader’s efforts to delay the nomination, the senator never seemed to rebuke the views expressed. In fact, when the confirmation hearings did begin, Biden had hardly allowed Baird to finish reading her opening statement before he began hammering on the issue of her employment of illegal aliens.
“As you know from our first meeting, I have a fairly, well, I won’t say fairly,” Biden told the nominee. “I have a very strong view relating to the matter to which you spoke last, and that is the hiring of undocumented workers by you and your husband.”
The senator proceeded to question Baird in a hostile tone that many found surprising given that she was nominated by a president of his own party. A notably contentious moment arose when Baird admitted she had knowingly hired the illegal couple, but was told by her lawyers not to worry as the crime amounted to little more than a “technical violation.”
“What I understood you just to say was that because of your need, you rationalized to yourself that this is ‘a technical violation,’ that it is enforced [rarely] … and that in time, by going through the process, you would be able to make this right by them getting a green card,” Biden asked with an air of incredulity. “Is that what you’re saying to me?”
When Baird responded that she believed the Immigration and Naturalization Service provided a pathway to residency in such cases, the senator seemed to imply she was willingly deceiving herself.
“It’s amazing, the ability of the human condition to rationalize, to justify what you know is not right,” Biden said.
The nominee, perhaps realizing the man entrusted to steer her confirmation was committed to sinking it instead, began to make broader justifications and excuses for her conduct—seeming to only infuriate Biden.
“Speaking for myself only, it is my impression that it is not just me but a significant portion of the population that finds your action and the action of your husband to be on its face inconsistent with the responsibilities that you will have as attorney general,” he said, before adding that “there are tens of thousands, millions of Americans out there who have trouble taking care of their children.”
There “are single parents with one fiftieth of the income that you and your husband have and that they do not violate the law,” Biden added.
The senator’s line of questioning, which was noted by the media as the most critical of any member of the Judiciary Committee, signaled that Baird’s candidacy was doomed. That became all the more clear when on the second day of the hearings two of the committee’s newest female members, Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Carol Mosley-Braun (D-IL), showed little sympathy for the nominee.
Shortly afterwards, Biden’s staff told the press their office had been inundated with calls from voters across the country about the nomination, the overwhelming majority of which were negative.
“Biden’s office reported receiving 1,511 phone calls against Baird through Tuesday compared with only 53 in favor,” the Washington Post wrote at the time.
With the press reporting of widespread opposition from the public, Baird’s support within the Judiciary Committee began to fall. The committee’s Republican members were the first to voice their decision to vote no, followed by two Southern Democrats, who more politely called on Clinton to withdraw the nomination.
Biden, for his part, waited until the new president was in office for at least two days before doing the same in private. Clinton promptly followed the advice, informing Baird he was withdrawing her nomination. The first potential female attorney general quietly acquiesced, slinking back to her half a million dollar job at Aetna.
The role Biden played in Baird’s demise, despite drawing accusations of sexism, did not deter his political relationship with Clinton. The president continued to rely on Biden, even tasking the senator with writing his landmark 1994 crime bill and being the point man on several Supreme Court appointments.
Baird’s nomination battle comes back into the spotlight as Biden, now running for the 2020 Democrat nomination, struggles to accommodate his long held stance on immigration to a party increasingly favoring open borders. Earlier this week the former vice president sparked widespread criticism from the left for claiming illegal immigrants needed to learn English as a prerequisite for receiving U.S. citizenship."
75,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Andrew Yang’s (D) campaign on Saturday blasted the Democratic National Committee (DNC) after the presidential hopeful failed to meet the polling threshold required to participate in next week’s debate in Des Moines, Iowa.
Yang failed to meet the required polling threshold ahead of the January 10 deadline, which required candidates to garner at least five percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls or seven percent in two early state polls — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. Candidates also needed to report at least 225,000 individual donors with 1,000 in at least 20 states.


Only six candidates — Joe Biden (D), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), former Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), and Tom Steyer — made the debate stage, leaving a lineup composed entirely of white candidates.

While Yang reached the donor requirement, he fell two polls short of qualifying. The Yang campaign blamed the DNC, arguing that it did not conduct enough polls in early states.
“If the DNC had only done their due diligence and commissioned polls in the early states, Andrew Yang would certainly be on the debate stage next week,” Yang campaign chief Nick Ryan said in an email to supporters, according to the Hill.
“We are not going to allow the DNC to dictate who they wish to see as the nominee and deny the will of the people,” he continued, contending that Yang is “on the rise and at 5% in Nevada and New Hampshire.”
“The issues that will decide this election, and the future of our country, are too important to ignore for the sake of staged political bickering. The DNC tried to run this same play in 2016 and they paid for it with a loss in the general,” Ryan added.

A CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll released Friday showed Sanders taking a narrow lead in the Hawkeye State with 20 percent support."
76,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has taken the lead in Iowa less than a month ahead of the February 3 caucus, a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll released Friday revealed.
The poll, taken January 2-8, 2020, among 701 Democrat caucus-goers, found the socialist senator taking the lead in the Hawkeye State with 20 percent support, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who followed closely behind with 17 percent support.


Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who was previously leading in Iowa, came in one percentage point behind Warren with 16 percent support. Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) fell to fourth place with 15 percent support. The margin of error of +/- 3.7 percent indicates an extremely tight race among the top tier of candidates.

Sanders’ lead reflects a five-point jump from November’s results.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) came in fifth place with six percent support, followed by Andrew Yang (D) with five percent support. The remaining candidates saw three percent support or less.
“There’s no denying that this is a good poll for Bernie Sanders. He leads, but it’s not an uncontested lead,” pollster J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., said of the results. “He’s got a firmer grip on his supporters than the rest of his compatriots.”
The results come just days from next week’s Democrat debate in Des Moines, Iowa. Only six candidates have qualified, including Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg, Biden, Klobuchar, and Tom Steyer (D)."
77,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"ROME — Christian sites in Europe suffered a record number of attacks in the year 2019, with some 3,000 Christian churches, schools, cemeteries, and monuments vandalized, looted, or defaced.
Reports compiling the anti-Christian acts during the year document a range of profanation including arson, defecation, desecration, looting, mockery, Satanism, theft, urination, and vandalism.


“Sadly, 2019 was punctuated by increasing incidents of desecration and vandalism of churches around Europe, along with the 2019 fire at the Notre-Dame Cathedral, which captured worldwide attention,” the director of The Observatory on Intolerance and Discrimination Against Christians in Europe, Ellen Fantini, told Breitbart News on Saturday.
“In most instances the perpetrators of these acts were unidentified, but the Observatory has documented that churches and other symbols of Christianity in Europe are targets for many groups — from Islamists to radical feminists, LGBT activists to anarchists and self-proclaimed Satanists,” Ms. Fantini said.
In all, some 3,000 Christian churches, schools, cemeteries, and monuments were vandalized, looted or defaced in Europe during 2019, making it a record year for anti-Christian sacrilege.

The greatest number of acts of violence against Christian sites have occurred in France, where churches, schools, cemeteries, and monuments “are being vandalized, desecrated, and burned at an average rate of three per day,” according to reports citing government statistics.
Germany is not far behind, with attacks against Christian churches happening at an average rate of two per day. Meanwhile, attacks on Christian churches and symbols regularly occurred in 2019 in Belgium, the UK, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, and Spain as well.
While the violence overwhelmingly involves Roman Catholic sites and symbols, in Germany, Protestant churches have also been targeted.
Police and mainstream media almost always censor information about the identities and ethnic backgrounds of the perpetrators, so it is difficult to get a clear idea as to who is committing the crimes and the motives behind them — especially when they are religiously driven.
In France and Germany, the sharp rise in anti-Christian attacks has coincided with the recent mass immigration from the Muslim world, yet the lack of official statistics makes it impossible to know precisely how many attacks can be attributed to Islamic anti-Christian hostility.

“European governments and politicians, with a few exceptions, seem reluctant to address this problem,” Ms. Fantini told Breitbart.
Fantini said she agrees with former UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt that “the UK and other Western governments have not grappled with the issue perhaps because of a misguided political correctness or an instinctive reluctance to talk about religion.”
In 2019, only nine European states reported hate crime data relating to Christians to the OSCE for their hate crime report, Fantini noted, which is fewer than the number of states that report hate crimes with an anti-Muslim or antisemitic bias.
According to Bishop Dominique Rey of Fréjus-Toulon, we are “witnessing the convergence of laicism – conceived as secularism, which relegates the faithful only to the private sphere and where every religious denomination is banal or stigmatized – with the overwhelming emergence of Islam, which attacks the infidels and those who reject the Koran.

78,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"A recent report outlines how social media services and search engines such as Facebook and Google handle political advertising on their platforms. The Masters of the Universe remain divided on how they believe political ads should be presented.
In an article titled “Factbox: How Social Media Services Handle Political Ads,” Reuters outlines how tech firms such as Facebook and Google handle political advertising across their various platforms as they face growing pressure to remove ads that contain false or misleading information ahead of the 2020 presidential election cycle.


Reuters explains that in the United States, the Communications Act prevents broadcast stations from rejecting or censoring ads from political candidates once they have accepted advertising for that political race. This does not, however, apply to cable networks such as CNN or to social media sites, meaning how the tech firms deal with political ads is at their own discretion.

 
Breitbart News recently reported that Facebook has not backed down from its decision to not fact check political ads despite intense pressure to do so. In comparison to Facebook, Twitter has outright banned political ads on its platform. Reuters described Twitter’s attitude towards political ads writing:
Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) has banned political ads. In November, it said this will include ads that reference a political candidate, party, election or legislation, among other limits.
The company also said it will not allow ads that advocate for a specific outcome on political or social causes.
“We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought,” said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in a statement last month.
 
Google does not have an outright ban on misleading or false ads but rather deals with allegations of false advertising information on a case by case basis. The Internet giant is limited how political ads are targeted, which the Trump campaign takes great issue with.
Google said on Wednesday that it would limit audience targeting for election ads to age, gender and general location at a postal code level.
The change means political advertisers can no longer target ads using data such as public voter records and general political affiliations such as right-leaning, left-leaning or independent. Advertisers can still do contextual targeting, such as showing ads to users watching a certain video.
Google and its video-streaming service YouTube prohibit certain kinds of misrepresentation here in ads, such as misinformation about public voting procedures, political candidate eligibility based on age or birthplace or incorrect claims that a public figure has died.

79,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Babson College has fired professor Asheen Phansey this week after he published a post to Facebook in which he stated that Iran should choose targets to bomb in America including the Mall of America and the Kardashian family. The firing comes just one day after his suspension for the post.
According to a report by Fox News, Asheen Phansey was fired by Babson College this week after he joked on Facebook that Iran should consider bombing the Mall of America and the Kardashian residence.


Breitbart News reported on Thursday that Phansey had been suspended indefinitely from his post at Babson College over his poorly constructed Facebook post. It didn’t take Babson College much longer to escalate Phansey’s indefinite suspension to termination.

Phansey was responding to a tweet from President Trump in which the president threatened to attack 52 Iranian cultural sites if Iranian leaders continued to threaten America.
“In retaliation, Ayatollah Khomenei [sic] should tweet a list of 52 sites of beloved American cultural heritage that he would bomb,” Phansey wrote in the controversial post. “Um… Mall of America? Kardashian residence?”
Not everyone is defending Babson College’s decision to terminate Phansey. Adam Steinbaugh, director of the Individual Rights Defense Program at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), argued this week that Babson College’s decision to terminate Phansey suggests that the college has a limited commitment to freedom of expression.


“Babson College has terminated an adjunct professor for a personal Facebook post criticizing the President of the United States. The professor’s post⁠ is obvious rhetorical hyperbole and cannot reasonably be read as a threat, incitement, or even a sincere endorsement of violence,” Steinbaugh said in a statement. “Babson’s process-free termination of the professor in an attempt to quell criticism on social media is censorship, plain and simple, and reveals Babson’s stated commitment to freedom of expression to be worthless.”"
80,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Professor Thomas Hubbard of the University of Texas at Austin has come under fire from members of the community for his scholarly writing on the relationship between men and teenage boys. Some members of the community have even begun calling for Hubbard’s termination.
According to a report by The College Fix, UT Austin Professor Thomas Hubbard has come under fire for a series of scholarly pieces that have defended relationships between older men and teenage boys.


In December, the Dallas Morning News published an editorial entitled “A UT professor ‘researches’ pederasty. Why are we paying for it?” which focused on Hubbard’s research. “Pederasty” refers to sexual relationships between adult men and pubescent or adolescent boys. Such relationships are considered child sexual abuse or statutory rape in most of the modern world.

In one passage from Hubbard’s published research, the classics professor went as far as to argue that pederastic relationships were beneficial to young men in Ancient Greece.
In Ancient Greece, “where age-discrepant relationships are commonplace and positively reinforced, they cause little or no long-term harm to the younger partner and often confer great benefit,” Hubbard wrote.
Hubbard claims that he does not hold a radical position on age of consent laws. In an interview, he claimed that he has advocated for a softening of America’s age of consent laws, but only to match those of most European states.
“I have never said anything more radical than that we should consider moving in the direction of what most European states do, which is to maintain an age of consent of 14 or 15 with special protections against prostitution of those under 18 or involvement with an adult who is in a position of trust (family members, teachers, therapists, clergy),” Hubbard told The College Fix."
81,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"University of Michigan professor Juan Cole referred to President Donald Trump as “a mad bomber in the White House” on Wednesday at an anti-war protest on campus. The professor added that President Trump, along with Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, is “making war” on the “climate.”
“We have a mad bomber in the White House,” proclaimed professor Juan Cole at a Wednesday protest at the University of Michigan, entitled, “No War On Iran.”


“We have somebody who’s erratic,” he continued. “We have a secretary of defense who’s a lobbyist for the arms industry. We have a secretary of state who is a Kansas oilman.”
The professor went on to claim that President Trump, Secretary of Defense Esper, and Secretary of State Pompeo are “making war,” not just on the Middle East, but “climate” as well.
“The three of them together are making war on our climate and on the Middle East,” he insisted.

“The Trump Administration did not strike Iran for the first time this week. The Trump Administration has had Iran under the severest economic blockade in modern history,” continued Cole, expressing his dismay over the president having “put so many sanctions on Iran.”
“Trump has put a pillow over the baby of Iran and [unintelligible] to strangle the lives of people,” said Cole. “Iran was on the verge of being welcomed into the world community, it was going to buy Boeing jets.”
The professor went on to falsely claim that the United States is at war with Iran, adding, “[the United States] is trying to destroy people’s lives,” and referring to the killing of Quds Force leader Qasem Soleimani was “an assassination.”
“We have a rogue government,” said Cole of the Trump Administration.
The protest was co-sponsored by a laundry list of student groups, some of which included the Huron Valley Democratic Socialists of America, Arab Student Association, Huron Valley Democratic Socialists of America, College Democrats at the University of Michigan, and Collective Against White Supremacy.

Professor Cole was introduced to the stage by a student, who said that the difference between now and the early 2000’s is that “the American people have learned their lesson” with regards to conflict in the Middle East.
“What we are here for is to put an end to U.S. imperialism,” said the student of the protest, “and to build an anti-war movement in this country that is strong enough, such that the United States cannot go around doing things like what it just did.”
The student added that even though President Trump “sounds like he doesn’t want to go to war,” the anti-war protest is still relevant because the president said, “sanctions were going to go way up.”
“So, just wanted to clarify — for anyone who’s confused, this is still highly relevant,” she insisted.

82,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Urban Design blog Curbed published an article recently which takes issue with Elon Musk’s Boring Company tunnel, which was unveiled at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show. According to the article, what was once touted as an underground transportation system has turned into a “mechanism for giving one-minute test rides in Teslas.”
In an article titled “Stop Calling Elon Musk’s Boring Tunnel Public Transit,” Curbed writer Alissa Walker raises issues with Elon Musk’s Boring Company tunnel being built in Las Vegas to transport people from one side of the Las Vegas convention center to the other, and should be ready for next year’s Consumer Electronics Show.


The Boring Company began work on the project in November of 2019 and planned to develop an underground transportation system to carry passengers less than a mile from one end of the convention center to the other. The tunnel is being built as part of a $46.68 million contract with the city’s convention and tourism authority.

Steve Hill, president of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, said at the tunnel’s November groundbreaking: “I think that 10, 15, 20 years from now, we’ll look back at this as a Kitty Hawk–type moment. This technology has the ability to change transportation not only here at the convention center, which is important to us, and here in Las Vegas, but around the country and around the world.”
 
Curbed notes that the Boring Company’s latest renderings of the tunnel don’t include the 16-passenger public transit vehicles that Musk promoted in 2017, but rather show Tesla Model 3 cars that can hold five passengers maximum. Curbed.com writes:
The vehicles also won’t be going 155 mph, as has been widely reported. Because the vehicles will travel between three stations along the 0.83-mile route, they will only reach speeds of up to 50 mph in each 0.4-mile segment.
And last month, Musk confirmed that the tunnels being dug by the Boring Company were indeed “road tunnels,” not transit tunnels at all, where the vehicles would travel on tires, not tracks. “Really, just an underground road, but limited to EVs (from all auto companies),” he tweeted.
Walker also notes that Musk has changed his tune about his tunnels in general, including how he plans to fix the issue of “soul destroying” traffic in Los Angeles:
 
But when transportation planners pointed out that the only way tunnels relieve traffic is by moving high-capacity vehicles, Musk went on the defensive. At a different conference, he bashed public transportation—where riders must share space with “a bunch of random strangers, one of whom might be a serial killer”—and called an influential transit consultant an “idiot.”
Then, in June 2018—about six months after his dustup with advocates—Musk abruptly changed his tune: The Boring Company’s plans would be adjusted to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists over cars. “Will still transport cars but only after all personalized mass transit needs are met,” he wrote on Twitter. “If someone can’t afford a car, they should go first.”
But Musk has provided no explanation for how, exactly, that would work.

83,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Recently published emails between employees at Boeing revealed that the company dissuaded Lion Air from training pilots that would fly the 737 Max aircraft in Boeing’s simulators. Lion Air Flight 610, which was a 737 Max, crashed in October 2018, killing all passengers on board.
According to a report by Forbes, employees at Boeing encouraged officials at the Indonesian Airline Lion Air to forego simulator tests for the 737 Max fleet, an aircraft that many airlines, including Lion Air, were preparing to use for commercial flights.


In a series of messages published this week, Boeing’s 737 Chief Technical Pilot Mark Forkner wrote that pilots would not need simulator training to fly a 737 Max. Forkner said he would even battle with regulators that might want to make 737 Max simulator training mandatory.

“I want to stress the importance of holding firm that there will not be any type of simulator training required to transition from NG to MAX. Boeing will not allow that to happen. We’ll go face to face with any regulator who tries to make that a requirement,” Forkner wrote in one message.
In another message, this time to Lion Air, Forkner encouraged the airline to forego simulator training. “I am concerned that if [Lion] chooses to require a MAX simulator for its pilots beyond what all other regulators are requiring that it will be creating a difficult and unnecessary training burden for your airline, as well as potentially establish a precedent in your region for other MAX customers,” Forkner said his message to Lion Air.
Forkner wasn’t the only Boeing employee that didn’t want Lion Air to participate in 737 Max simulator training. One unnamed Boeing employee said that Lion Air would only need simulator training for the new fleet of aircraft because of their “stupidity.”
“Now [Lion Air] might need a sim to fly the MAX, and maybe because of their own stupidity,” the employee wrote.
Breitbart News has written extensively on Boeing’s tribulations with its 737 Max fleet. Breitbart News reported this week on internal messages from one Boeing employee who said that the 737 Max fleet was “designed by clowns.”

85,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"It has been more than three years since President Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, but all of Clinton’s emails at the center of the email scandal that plagued her failed presidential campaign have still not seen the light of day.
But on Friday, conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch announced the FBI produced 37 new pages of Clinton emails demonstrating she mishandled classified information and used text messages for official business as well.


Judicial Watch announced in a press release on Friday:

Judicial Watch today released 37 pages of new Clinton emails recently found by the FBI that show former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used her unsecure, non-government email to transmit classified information. The new emails also show Clinton used text messages for government business. The documents, produced to Judicial Watch after a review by the State Department, include 13 new Clinton emails. The State Department did not provide information about where the emails were found; why they were not previously produced; or if additional records are anticipated. Last month, a Justice Department attorney could not tell a federal court judge how and where the FBI discovered the new cache of Clinton emails. The State Department previously claimed it had produced all releasable Clinton emails, including emails recovered by the FBI that Hillary Clinton tried to destroy or withhold. The State Department initially claimed all responsive emails had been produced in 2018, but then found more emails which were produced, for the first time, early last year. Then in November 2019, the State Department first disclosed to the court that the FBI had found this latest batch of emails.
The 37 pages of new emails that the FBI discovered were made public Friday thanks to Judicial Watch’s litigation against the State Department, as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit the organization has been waging against the government for more transparency on this.
The new batch of emails discovered and published Friday includes Clinton using her personal email to communicate with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair; Clinton conducting official business with then-Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman, who suggested she meet in 2011 with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati; and Clinton emailing with her aide Huma Abedin about “text messages” and coordinating getting her “confidential assistant” Monica Hanley to “the Hamptons” to help her get organized. Hanley has been exposed in the past for having mishandled or misplaced sensitive government information.
A number of these newly revealed emails, including the Blair one and several others, contain classified information as well.
Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, said the revelations in these emails demonstrate that a fresh criminal investigation into Clinton is necessary, as these newly discovered emails prove she regularly transmitted classified information via her insecure server system.
“Magically, after years, the FBI finds more Clinton emails that show Clinton used text messages for government work, not to mention the continuing flow of classified information transmitted over her unsecure email system,” Fitton said. “These documents further underscore the need for a fresh, unbiased and thorough criminal investigation into Clinton’s blatant malfeasance – and the related DOJ, FBI, and State Department cover-up.”"
86,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"On Friday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Newsroom,” former Secretary of State John Kerry declared that former President Barack Obama’s administration “never had a whiff of scandal.”

That’s why I’m here.”


“I believe Joe Biden is the only person who has the set of relationships around the world, who has had this unbelievable breadth of experience as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and then as vice president for eight years, and an administration, by the way, which never had a whiff of scandal,” he added.

87,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) — Neil Peart, the renowned drummer and lyricist from the influential Canadian band Rush, has died. He was 67.
His representative, Elliot Mintz, said in a statement Friday that Peart died at his home Tuesday in Santa Monica, California. The band posted a message on Twitter also confirming the news.


“It is with broken hearts and the deepest sadness that we must share the terrible news that on Tuesday our friend, soul brother and band mate over 45 years, Neil, has lost his incredibly brave three and a half year battle with brain cancer,” the band wrote. “Rest in peace brother.”
Peart placed fourth on Rolling Stone’s list of 100 Greatest Drummers of All Time, just behind Ginger Baker, Keith Moon and John Bonham. Peart’s jaw-dropping percussion skills, though, were matched by his wondrous skill with lyrics as Rush composed song after thought-provoking song that deftly explored the human condition or conjured up mysterious realms beyond the humdrum life of the band’s heyday in the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s. Peart was precise, deliberate and skilled behind his sprawling drum kit, but his innovative lyrics helped set Rush apart from other prog rock bands.
Rush was a power trio that rock had never quite seen before, with the searing guitar work of Alex Lifeson, the bass, keyboards and vocals of Geddy Lee and the fantastical drumming of Peart, who was no mere backing member of the rhythm section but rather an indispensable leg of the unusual tripod. The band still finds airplay today with anthems like “The Spirit of Radio” and “Tom Sawyer” — perhaps its best-known song — and “Subdivisions,” with its searing assessment of early ’80s life in cookie-cutter housing tracts: “Be cool or be cast out.”

The band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2013, and honored for combining “the signature traits of progressive rock with a proto typical heavy-metal sound.”
“We’ve always said it’s not something that meant a lot to us, but we knew our fans cared so much to be validated like that — that their favorite band like their favorite sports team should be celebrated as champions,” Peart told The Associated Press at the time. “We always knew that was the case and certainly to see it blossom after this is a testament to the truth of that.”
Peart was born on Sept. 12, 1952 in Ontario. Music became an outlet for the self-described introvert who remained a quiet, under-the-radar star his entire career.
“I was very academic until I discovered drums,” he explained in a 2017 interview with Classic Rock. “Then I was a monomaniac about drumming. I was physically awkward. My ankles were weak, so I couldn’t play any sports. I couldn’t skate and I couldn’t play hockey, which in Canada is like football is in the U.K. And that makes you a pariah as a boy.”
When Rush formed in 1968, its original lineup included Lifeson, bassist Jeff Jones and drummer John Rutsey. After a few weeks, Lee replaced Jones, and in 1974, Peart replaced Rutsey weeks before Rush’s first U.S. tour. Rush’s first album with Peart — by then the band’s principal songwriter — was 1975’s platinum-seller “Fly by Night.” They released another album that same year, “Caress of Steel,” which reached gold status.

In 1976 the band marked a major breakthrough with the album “2112,” which sold three million units in the U.S. The first side of the album tells the tale of a dystopian world where creativity, individualism and music itself are outlawed — Peart was a reader of Ayn Rand — only to have things unravel when someone discovers an abandoned guitar. It was an extraordinary effort and fans responded in droves.
Lee described working with Peart’s lyrics during a 2018 interview with The Guardian: “Being an interpreter for Neil has been a singular pleasure of mine and a really difficult job at the same time, because I’m not always on the same page as him. As we grew as a band, I became trusted by him to be his sounding board and his editor, and if I couldn’t get into a thing, he would leave it alone. That’s the beauty of a relationship that lasts.”

Rush’s most successful album was 1981’s “Moving Pictures,” which sold four million copies. The album featured “Tom Sawyer” and “YYZ” — a track that served as a showcase for Peart during live shows and secured Rush its first-ever Grammy nomination; the band would earn seven nominations over time. 1990’s “Chronicles” was a double platinum success; 11 of the band’s albums were certified platinum and 10 albums reached gold status.
Peart was also an author and published six books. At one point in the 1990s, he took jazz drumming instruction, explaining to Classic Rock: “After 40, 45 years of playing, I wanted to push myself and open up this whole new frontier. I’ve been able to do that as a lyricist and as a prose writer, and now as a drummer. You have to challenge your own limitations and your own expectations of yourself.”
In 2015, Peart announced he was retiring from touring, saying he was struggling with ailments and concerned he would not be able to play in top form.

High-profile musicians were among the fans of Peart and Rush who paid tribute on social media.
“Today the world lost a true giant in the history of rock and roll. An inspiration to millions with an unmistakable sound who spawned generations of musicians (like myself) to pick up two sticks and chase a dream. A kind, thoughtful, brilliant man who ruled our radios and turntables not only with his drumming, but also his beautiful words,” Dave Grohl, who inducted Rush into the Rock Hall, said in a statement Friday. “I still vividly remember my first listen of ‘2112’ when I was young. It was the first time I really listened to a drummer. And since that day, music has never been the same. His power, precision, and composition was incomparable. He was called ‘The Professor’ for a reason: we all learned from him.”
Jack Black tweeted, “The master will be missed — Neil Peart RIP #RushForever.” Gene Simmons called Peart “a kind soul,” while Chuck D of Public Enemy recalled being inducted into the Rock Hall on the same night as Rush, saying backstage he and Peart shared “a unique moment without much word. Rest in Beats my man.”
Slash, Bryan Adams, Paul Stanley and Questlove of The Roots also paid tribute to Peart.
“Thank you for inspiring me and for all your help and advice along the way, especially in the early days when you took the time to talk to a young green Danish drummer about recording, gear and the possibilities that lay ahead,” Metallica’s Lars Ulrich wrote on Twitter. “Thank you for what you did for drummers all over the world with your passion, your approach, your principles and your unwavering commitment to the instrument! Rest In Peace.”
Peart is survived by his wife, Carrie, and their daughter, Olivia Louise Peart."

89,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Actress and alternative health guru Gwyneth Paltrow is selling a “vagina-scented” candle on her website Goop, which quickly sold out as of Saturday evening.
The Ironman actress is selling the $75 “candle named “This Smells Like My Vagina,” which ” started as a joke between perfumer Douglas Little and GP,” according to the website.


“The two were working on a fragrance, and she blurted out, ‘Uhhh..this smells like a vagina’—but evolved into a funny, gorgeous, sexy, and beautifully unexpected scent,” the site states.

“With a funny, gorgeous, sexy, and beautifully unexpected scent, this candle is made with geranium, citrusy bergamot, and cedar absolutes juxtaposed with Damask rose and ambrette seed to put us in mind of fantasy, seduction, and a sophisticated warmth,” the product’s description states.
Paltrow has a controversial history in peddling questionable wellness products, promoting body vibes stickers, which it claimed could “rebalance the energy frequency in our bodies,” as well as sex dust, coffee enemas, “inner beauty” powder,  vaginal eggs, handcuff bangles, vaginal steamers, “Psychic Vampire Repellent,” a BDSM kit, and self-love spray.
The company settled a lawsuit in 2018, paying out $145,000 over unscientific claims made about the vaginal eggs. The wellness brand suggested the product could  “balance hormones, regulate menstrual cycles, prevent depression, prevent uterine prolapse and a combination of other illnesses,” as SF Gate reported.
The controversial wellness brand is coming back into the spotlight with the upcoming January 24 premiere of The Goop Lab on Netflix, which will examine “alternative health practices” and feature exorcisms, psychic mediums, and orgasms, according to the trailer.

“We’re here one time, one life. How can we really milk the shit out of this?” Paltrow asks in the trailer."
90,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"A road work sign on Highway 92 in Pine Knot, Kentucky was hacked to proposition drivers with the infamous meme.
“ROAD WORK AHEAD” was exchanged for “SEND NUDES” on early Thursday morning, according to local authorities. Officials with the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet confirmed that the password-protected system had been compromised to display one of the internet’s longest-lasting jokes.


According to local NBC affiliate WLWT, the sign in question “belonged to a contractor doing construction work on the Ky. 92 realignment project through McCreary and Whitley counties, near the Tennessee border.” The contractor has claimed that none of its employees were involved in the incident.

Amber Hale, a cabinet spokeswoman for District 8, told reporters that they “were notified this morning that the message was … different.” In response, officials “contacted [the contractor] and sent them immediately down to confirm it, they confirmed it, and they immediately turned the message board off.”
Driver Tevon Stephens said he noted the “clearly hacked” sign on his way to work. Despite the humorous nature of the message, he knew the situation had the potential for real danger. “But seriously, we needed to bring awareness to it so the road departments would add cameras or add locks to the equipment to keep from distracting the drivers,” Stephens said.
Similar prank messages on electronic road signs are relatively common. Dallas had “DONALD TRUMP IS A SHAPE SHIFTING LIZARD!!” and “WORK IS CANCELED / GO BACK HOME” in 2017, while “THE FUTURE SUCKS,” and “EXPECT PED/BIKE DEATHS” showed up in Berkeley, California."
91,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Kristine Johnson is suing the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for reporting her husband’s sexual abuse of an underage girl.
The lawsuit is an attempt to hold the church responsible for “loss of income, emotional distress and her family’s loss of her husband’s companionship,” to the tune of $9.5 million — plus $40,000 to cover their legal expenses. Johnson claims the church went against its principles of confidential confession when it reported her husband’s admission that he sexually abused an underage girl.


Johnson learned of her husband’s crime in 2016. She and her husband responded, according to the lawsuit, by “[following] the rules and scriptures of the church, which … requires and admonish church members to ‘confess their sins unto the brethren before the Lord.’”

The lawsuit argues that Kristine and her husband Timothy should have been advised that the confession would not remain private. Timothy Johnson was arrested for the sexual abuse of a minor in 2017, convicted of four counts of sexual abuse in 2018, and is currently serving a 15-year sentence in a Pendleton, Orgeon, prison.
In a statement, the Mormon organization maintains that it followed both its teachings and the Oregon state law that requires any confession of child abuse or neglect to be reported. “The church teaches that leaders and members should fulfill all legal obligations to report abuse to civil authorities,” church spokesman Eric Hawkins said.
University at Buffalo School of Law professor Christine Bartholomew told the Oregonian that the lawsuit’s outcome may affect more than just the Johnson family. “If successful, this litigation would push courts and these religious organizations toward less transparency than more,” she explained. “And you have to wonder if that would create the environment where abuse can really fester.”
David Clohessy, former national director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, lauded the church’s decision to protect Johnson’s victims more than their rapist. “It’s not just a parent’s job to protect their kids from predators, it’s the job of every single adult,” Clohessy said. “So adults who do put the safety of kids first should be applauded, not penalized.”"
92,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"A convicted sex offender from Michigan who claims to identify as an eight-year-old girl and who was caught with porn on his computer is now arguing it is protected by free speech.
Joseph Gobrick, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, was arrested after officers discovered illegal child pornography — including scenes of child rape — on his devices.


The 24-year-old convict attempted to argue that his porn was protected under the First Amendment.
Prosecutors, of course, argued that video and photos of children being raped are not protected free speech. Officials identified eight children being abused in the porn on Gobrick’s devices.
While representing himself at trial in Kent County Circuit Court, Gobrick brazenly exclaimed that he is not sexually attracted to children.

“I would no sooner have sex with a child than you would with a rattlesnake,” Gobrick insisted in court. “It’s just not safe.”
He also claimed that he identifies as an eight-year-old girl.
“I’ve always been an eight-year-old girl,” Gobrick claimed. “And even my drawings and fantasies, I am always an eight-year-old girl.”
Still, prosecutors pointed out that while in jail, Gobrick constantly drew pornographic images of children, where he similarly claimed it was his First Amendment right to do so.
“Based on everything he’s said and done, including bragging about what he was drawing in his cell, he obviously doesn’t think child sexually abusive material is wrong,” the judge said.
But the judge added, “This isn’t just virtual stuff; this is also real people being harmed.”
The court referenced the 17-year-old girl police found in Gobrick’s home in 2018. The girl had been reported missing and endangered. It was during that investigation that officers discovered the illegal porn on his computers.

93,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"A Florida man killed a 75-year-old veteran with his car Thursday, just to see what it would be like to end someone’s life.
Authorities have charged 21-year-old Justin Pennell of Hudson, Florida, with first-degree murder after confessing to intentionally running down an elderly veteran with his 2004 PT Cruiser “so he could see what it’s like to kill.” It was Pennell himself who called 911 to report the crime, after the impact rendered his vehicle inoperable.


Dispatchers received the call at approximately 3 p,m,. Responding officers found the presently unnamed victim deceased on the side of Aripeka Road. A quarter-mile away, Pennell was waiting with his car. The vehicle reportedly sustained damage from the impact to its bumper, hood and windshield.

Pennell admitted to purposefully targeting and killing a man he did not know, and said he was “trying to understand why he did this.” A local Fox affiliate reports that Pennell explained “he saw the victim walking along the roadway with a walking stick, so he made a U-turn, accelerated and purposely ran into the man.”
He also confessed to planning the killing in advance, having thought about it for months. “While he’s driving at his victim, he could see the look of fright on the victim’s face,” Sheriff Chris Nocco said. “This man is absolutely evil.”
“There are some cases … that make us realize there are pure evil in this world,” Nocco continued. “Because of the pure evil that happened yesterday, there’s a 75-year-old man, who’s a father, a grandfather, a Vietnam War veteran, who was killed.”"
94,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"A waitress plans to pay it forward after she got the biggest tip she had ever seen Tuesday at a restaurant in Sacramento, California.
When Kathleen Moreno served a small table of customers at the Wildwood Kitchen and Bar in the Pavilions, she had no idea what was about to happen, according to KCRA.


The group’s bill came out to nearly $165, but when Moreno got the check back after a woman at the table signed the receipt, she did a double-take.
“When she wrote the tip, I thought she just wrote that the total was $200. And then I looked closer — and there was an extra zero. I couldn’t stop shaking for about 30 minutes to an hour.”
The young waitress, who works two jobs to afford tuition at the American River College culinary school, said she had never met the people at the table before.

“She paid it forward to me, she didn’t have to do that,” Moreno commented, adding that she planned to use a portion of the money to have her car repaired and would donate some to help victims of the Australian bushfires.
The fires that have raged since September have covered about 17.3 million acres. That is about 400 times the size of Washington, DC, according to the Daily Mail Australia: 
The report continued:

At least 25 people are dead, almost 2,000 homes have been destroyed and a multi-billion dollar hole has been sunk in the economy by the devastating bushfires raging across Australia. … At least 20 people have been killed by bushfires in NSW since October, with three dead in South Australia and two in Victoria.

However, the young woman said she hoped her contribution would be a help to those who have lost so much due to the devastating wildfires.
“I’m a firm believer in karma. What you put into the world is what you get back,” she concluded."
95,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"An observant teenager made the discovery of a lifetime during his internship at NASA this summer in Greenbelt, Maryland.
When 17-year-old Wolf Cukier was assigned to look through the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) telescope at the Goddard Space Flight Center, he was surprised to find much more than just stars, according to WLNY.


The Scarsdale High School senior was looking at a system 1,300 light-years from Earth when he noticed a slight darkness in one of the system’s suns.
“The planet blocked the light from those two stars, leading to a small dip in the amount of light that reached the telescope. That’s what I noticed at first,” Wolf said, adding, “It was like, oh … there’s something here that was cool. But it’s also not like there’s a single moment of discovery.”
In the weeks following the event, the teenager worked with other scientists to confirm his hypothesis.

“Our confidence went up and down a couple of times, but by the end of the internship, we were confident that what we found was a planet,” Wolf said of the rare find.
The planet was about seven times the Earth in size and is only the 13th of its kind to ever be discovered. NASA kept the data under lock and key until this week.
Wolf’s mom, Beth, commented that there were PhD candidates who would do anything to find what her son did on the third day of his internship.
“It was an amazing, cool bit of serendipity,” she said.
Wolf told reporters that he planned to study physics or astrophysics at Stanford, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), or Princeton after graduating from high school.
“NASA or other research could be a cool career for my future. Again, still deciding, but that’s a serious possibility,” he said.
Thanks to Wolf’s discovery, the Goddard Space Flight Center now has a new planet to study."
96,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"Camille Wilson, a California bus driver, has been given a “hero award” by The Riverside Transit Agency for helping to find and return a missing man with dementia.
The Riverside bus driver was traveling along her usual route in Perris when she received an alert about a missing person — an elderly man suffering from dementia. “They gave a description on our device,” Wilson told a local ABC affiliate on Wednesday.




Because she personally greets each passenger that boards her bus, she immediately realized one of her passengers was the man in question. “They train us on what to do,” she explained. “I was able to put two and two together. When he said he was on his way to the casino — being that there’s no casinos in Perris — that triggered it for me.”
Wilson told the station she “feels good about making a difference” and is “grateful for the recognition” by her employer."
97,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran’s security forces deployed in large numbers across the capital on Sunday, expecting more protests after its Revolutionary Guard admitted to accidentally shooting down a passenger plane at a time of soaring tensions with the United States.
Riot police in black uniforms and helmets massed in Vali-e Asr Square, Tehran University and other landmarks as calls circulated for protests later in the day. Revolutionary Guard members patrolled the city on motorbikes and plainclothes security men were also out in force. People looked down as they walked briskly past the police, hoping not to draw attention to themselves.


The plane crash early Wednesday killed all 176 people on board, mostly Iranians and Iranian-Canadians. After initially pointing to a technical failure and insisting the armed forces were not to blame, authorities on Saturday finally admitted to accidentally shooting it down in the face of mounting evidence and accusations by Western leaders.
Iran downed the Ukrainian flight as it braced for retaliation after firing ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq housing U.S. forces. The ballistic missile attack, which caused no casualties, was a response to the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top general, in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad.
Iranians have expressed anger over the downing of the plane and the misleading explanations from senior officials in the wake of the tragedy. They are also mourning the dead, among whom were a large number of young people with promising futures who were studying abroad.

“Even talking about it makes my heart beat faster and makes me sad,” said Zahra Razeghi, a Tehran resident. “I feel ashamed when I think about their families.”
“The denial and covering up the truth over the past three days greatly added to the suffering and pain of the families, and me,” she added.
Another individual, who only identified himself as Saeed, said the largely state-run media had concealed the cause of the crash for “political reasons.”
“Later developments changed the game and they had to tell the truth,” he said.
Hundreds of students gathered at Tehran’s Shahid Beheshti University on Sunday to mourn the victims and protest against authorities for concealing the cause of the crash, the semi-official ISNA news agency reported. They later dispersed peacefully.

A candlelight ceremony late Saturday in Tehran turned into a protest, with hundreds of people chanting against the country’s leaders — including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — and police dispersing them with tear gas. Protests were also held in the city of Isfahan and elsewhere.
Police briefly detained the British ambassador to Iran, Rob Macaire, who said he went with the intention of attending the vigil and did not know it would turn into a protest.

“Can confirm I wasn’t taking part in any demonstrations!” he tweeted. “Went to an event advertised as a vigil for victims of #PS752 tragedy. Normal to want to pay respects — some of victims were British. I left after 5 mins, when some started chanting.”
He said he was arrested 30 minutes after leaving the area.
Britain said its envoy was detained “without grounds or explanation” and in “flagrant violation of international law.”

“The Iranian government is at a cross-roads moment. It can continue its march towards pariah status with all the political and economic isolation that entails, or take steps to deescalate tensions and engage in a diplomatic path forwards,” Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement.
Iran’s Foreign Ministry said it was awaiting a police report on the arrest.
The semi-official Tasnim news agency cited an unnamed official as saying the ambassador was suspected of organizing and provoking the protesters, which was in violation of diplomatic protocol and justified his arrest on national security grounds.
It said he was taken to the Foreign Ministry, which later released him.
Alaeddin Boroujerdi, a member of Iran’s parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy, also accused the ambassador of organizing protests and called for his expulsion.
Iranian media meanwhile focused on the admission of responsibility for the crash, with several newspapers calling for those responsible to apologize and resign.
The hardline daily Vatan-e Emrouz bore the front-page headline, “A sky full of sadness,” while the Hamshahri daily went with “Shame,” and the IRAN daily said “Unforgivable.”
Mehdi Karroubi, an opposition activist under house arrest, lashed out at Khamenei himself.
“You, as the commander in chief of the armed forces, are directly responsible for this,” he said in a statement. “If you were aware and you let military and security authorities deceive people, then there is no doubt you lack the attributes of constitutional leadership.”
Criticism of the supreme leader is punishable by up to two years in prison.
Tensions with the United States eased after the ballistic missile attack, when President Donald Trump declined to respond and welcomed Iran’s apparent decision to stand down.
The emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, traveled to Iran for talks with senior officials. Qatar hosts a large U.S. military base and shares an offshore gas field with Iran. It has often served as a mediator between the two countries, which have no diplomatic relations.
Syria’s Prime Minister Imad Khamis was also leading a high-level delegation to Iran, which includes the defense and foreign ministers. Syrian state media described it as an “important visit” in light of recent events, without elaborating. Iran is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad in his country’s civil war, and Soleimani had mobilized militias and coordinated military aid.
Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi was also traveling to Iran, with plans to visit Saudi Arabia the following day."
98,Breitbart Media,Conservative,"On Thursday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) told TMZ that due to the effects of climate change people her age were “stressed” about having children.
Ocasio-Cortez said, “I mean, this is our future because I think for us the stakes are so high. I’m going to live in a world that is fundamentally altered by climate change. So is Greta, so is every young person. You know, if you are pretty much under the — first of all, we’re seeing it now. Like, we’re living through this right now. We’re experiencing it right now. But especially if you are under 50 years old, if you’re under 40, 30, you know, 20, the younger you are, the more of our lives and our futures are going to be impacted by this.”


She added, “Even people my age are stressed and have anxiety about having kids just because we want to make sure that we’re bringing our kids into a healthy world, into a stable future. And you shouldn’t ever have to be anxious about that. We need to be advocating for a safe future for all of us.”
